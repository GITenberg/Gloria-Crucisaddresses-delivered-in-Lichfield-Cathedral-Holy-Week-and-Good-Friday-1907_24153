ix</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>These addresses, delivered in Lichfield Cathedral <a
name="citation0"></a><a href="#footnote0"
class="citation">[0]</a> in Holy Week, 1907, are published at the
request of some who heard them.&nbsp; It has only been possible
to endeavour to reproduce them in substance.</p>
<p>The writer desires to express his obligations to various works
from which he has derived much assistance, such as, above all, Du
Bose&rsquo;s <i>Gospel in the Gospels</i>, Askwith&rsquo;s
<i>Conception of Christian Holiness</i>, Tennant&rsquo;s
<i>Origin of Sin</i>, and Jevons&rsquo; <i>Introduction to the
History of Religion</i>.</p>
<p>To the first and the last of these he is especially indebted
in regard to the view here taken of the Atonement.</p>
<p>It seems to him that no view of that great and central truth
can possibly be true, which (i) represents it as the result of a
transaction between the Father and the Son, which is ditheism
pure and simple; or which (ii) regards it as intended to relieve
us of the penalty of our sins, instead of having as its one
motive, meaning, and purpose the &ldquo;cure of
sinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far as we can see, the results of sin, seen and <!-- page
x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>unseen,
in this world and beyond it, must follow naturally and
necessarily from that constitution of the universe (including
human nature) which is the expression of the Divine Mind.&nbsp;
If this is true, and if that Mind is the Mind of Him Who is Love,
then all punishment must be remedial, must have, for its object
and intention at least, the conversion of the sinner.&nbsp; And,
therefore, the desire to escape from punishment, if natural and
instinctive, is also non-moral, for it is the desire to shirk
God&rsquo;s remedy for sin, and doomed never to realise its hope,
for it is the desire to reverse the laws of that Infinite
Holiness and Love which governs the world.</p>
<p>Yet this must be understood with one all-important
reservation.&nbsp; For the worst punishment of sin, is sin
itself, the alienation of the soul from God, with its consequent
weakening of the will, dulling of the reason, and corrupting of
the affections.&nbsp; And it was from this punishment, from this
&ldquo;hardest hell,&rdquo; which is sin, or the character
spoiled and ruined by sin, that Christ died to deliver us.</p>
<p>It follows that it is high time to dismiss all those theories
of the Atonement which ultimately trace their origin to the
enduring influence of Roman law.&nbsp; There is no remission of
penalty offered to us in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The
offer which is there held out to us, is that which answers to our
deepest need, to the inmost longings of the human soul,
&ldquo;the remission of our <i>sins</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>The idea of a penalty owing to the &ldquo;justice&rdquo;
of God is a thoroughly legalistic one, the offspring of an age
which thought in terms of law.&nbsp; It deals throughout with
abstractions.&nbsp; The very word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; is a
general notion, a concept, the work of the mind abstracting from
particulars.&nbsp; Justice and mercy are used like counters in
some theological game at which we are invited to play.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Penalty,&rdquo; again, is a term which serves to obscure
the one important fact that God, as a Moral Person or, rather, as
the One Self-Existent Being, of Whose nature and essence morality
is the expression, can only have one motive in dealing with
sinners, and that is, to reconcile them to Himself, to restore
them to that true ideal of their nature, which is the Image of
Himself in the heart of every man.&nbsp; Who can measure the pain
and anguish which that restoration must cost, to the sinner
himself, and (such is the wonderful teaching of the Cross) to
God, the All-Holy One, Who comes into a world of sin in order to
restore him?</p>
<p>There is no room here, at all events, for light and trivial
thoughts of sin.&nbsp; That charge might be levelled, with more
excuse, at the view that sin only incurs an external penalty,
from which we can be cheaply delivered by the sufferings of
another.</p>
<p>And theories of the Atonement which centre in the conception
of penalty are often only modifications of the crude and glaring
injustice of the Calvinistic view.&nbsp; The doctrine of a kind
of bargain between <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>the Father and the Son, while it
revolts our moral instincts, at the same time logically leads to
the purely heathen notion of two gods.</p>
<p>There are two main principles which are essential to a right
understanding of the Atonement: (1) The oneness of Christ both
with God and with humanity.&nbsp; In regard to neither is He, nor
can He be, &ldquo;Another&rdquo;; (2) the death of Christ was the
representation in space and time of a moral fact.&nbsp; It
happened as an &ldquo;event&rdquo; in history, in order that that
moral fact, of which it was the embodiment and symbol, might
become a fact in the spiritual experience of mankind.&nbsp; That
death was more than a symbol, because it was the actual means by
which that which it represented might be, and has been, in the
lives of all Christians accomplished.&nbsp; These two principles
the writer has, with whatever degree of failure or inadequacy,
endeavoured to embody in the following addresses.</p>
<p>And yet the Atonement, which is, in the broadest aspect of it,
Christianity itself, is a fact infinitely greater and higher than
any mere theories of it.&nbsp; For it is nothing less than this,
the personal action of the living Christ on the living souls of
men.&nbsp; That his readers and himself may experience this
action in ever-increasing measure is the prayer of him who, as he
fears, too greatly daring, has endeavoured to set forth, yet once
more, &ldquo;The Glory of the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>GLORIA CRUCIS</h2>
<h3>I<br />
THE GLORY OF THE CROSS</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God forbid that I should glory save in the
Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Gal.</span> <span class="smcap">vi.</span> 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are at least two reasons, unconnected with Holy Week,
why the subject of the Cross of Christ should occupy our
attention.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first reason is, that the Cross is commonly
recognised as the weak point in our Christianity.&nbsp; It is the
object of constant attack on the part of its assailants: and
believers are content too often to accept it &ldquo;on
faith,&rdquo; which means that they despair of giving a rational
explanation of it.&nbsp; Too often, indeed, Christians have
proclaimed and have gloried in its supposed irrationality.&nbsp;
To this latter point we shall return.&nbsp; But in the meanwhile
it is necessary to say this: all language of harshness towards
those who attack the doctrine of the Atonement is completely <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>out
of place.&nbsp; For the justification of their attacks has very
often come from the Christian side.&nbsp; In former times, far
more commonly than now, the sacrifice of Christ has been
represented as a substitutory offering, necessary to appease the
wrath of an offended God.&nbsp; It used to be said, and in some
quarters it is said to-day, that the sins of the human race had
so provoked the Divine anger that it could be appeased by nothing
short of the destruction of mankind.&nbsp; In these dire straits
of mankind, the Sinless Son of God presented Himself as the
object on which the full vials of the Father&rsquo;s wrath should
be outpoured.&nbsp; God having been thus placated, and His wrath
satisfied, such as believe in this transaction, and rest
themselves in confidence upon it, are enabled in such wise to
reap its benefits that they escape the penalty due to their
transgression, and are restored to the Divine favour.</p>
<p>Now this is the crudest representation of a certain popular
theology of the Atonement.&nbsp; With some of its features
softened down, it is by no means without its adherents and
exponents at the present day.&nbsp; But when its drift is clearly
understood, it is seen to be a doctrine which no educated man of
our time can accept.&nbsp; We may consider four fatal objections
to it.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) It is true that there is such a thing as &ldquo;the
wrath of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not only a fact, but one of the
most tremendous facts in the universe.&nbsp; It is a fact <!--
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>as
high as the Divine purity, as deep as the malignity and foulness
of sin, as broad as all human experience.&nbsp; It is impossible
to construct a theistic theory of the world which shall leave it
out.&nbsp; The nature of the fact we shall investigate at a later
point.&nbsp; But we can say this at once.&nbsp; It cannot be such
a fact as is represented by the theory under review.&nbsp; For
that represents the wrath of God as a mere thirst for vengeance,
a burning desire to inflict punishment, a rage that can only be
satisfied by pain, and blood, and death.&nbsp; In other words, we
are driven to a conception of God which is profoundly immoral,
and revoltingly pagan.&nbsp; If we are rightly interested in
missions to the heathen, are there to be no attempts to convert
our fellow-Christians whose conception of God scarcely rises
above the heathen one of a cruel and sanguinary deity?&nbsp; Not
such, at least, is the New Testament doctrine of Him Who is God
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) There is no moral quality which we esteem higher
than justice.&nbsp; Fairness, equity, straight dealing are
attributes for which all men entertain a hearty and unfeigned
respect.&nbsp; There is no flame of indignation which burns
fiercer within us than when we conceive ourselves, or others, to
be the victims of injustice.&nbsp; But what are we to say of a
view of the Atonement which represents God Himself as being
guilty of the most flagrant act of injustice that the mind of man
has ever conceived, the <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>infliction of condign punishment upon
a perfectly innocent Person, and that for the offences committed
by others?&nbsp; It is a further wrong, and that a wrong done to
the offenders themselves, that they are, in consideration of the
sufferings of the righteous One, relieved of the merited and
healthful punishment of ill-doing.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) A third defect of this theory of the Atonement is,
that it is profoundly unethical.&nbsp; The need of man is
represented as being, above all, escape from penalty.&nbsp;
Whereas, at least, the conscience of the sinner himself is
bearing at all times witness to the truth that his real necessity
is escape from his sin, from the weakness and the defilement of
his moral nature, which are of the very essence of moral
transgression.&nbsp; We are now dealing with the matter from the
moral standpoint; but we have to support us the authority of the
earliest proclamation of the work of the Christ: &ldquo;He shall
save His people from their sins,&rdquo; not from any pains or
penalties attached to their sins.&nbsp; Relief from punishment is
not the Gospel of the New Testament, it is not a gospel at
all.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Finally, the idea of a transaction between the
Father and the Son is clean contrary to the fundamental Christian
doctrine of the Unity of God.&nbsp; Once locate justice in the
Father, and love in the Son, and view the Atonement as the result
of a bargain, or transaction between the Two, and once more we
are left with a doctrine not Christian, but <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>heathen and
polytheistic.&nbsp; There is unhappily little doubt, that the
doctrine of the Holy Trinity suffers, just as that of the
Atonement, even more from its defenders than from its
assailants.&nbsp; Properly understood, that doctrine is the
vindication of the complete fulness of the personal life of the
One God.&nbsp; Too often it is so held, and so preached and
represented, as in this case, that monotheism is tacitly
abandoned in favour of ditheism or tritheism.&nbsp; It needs to
be plainly said, that the transaction theory is inconsistent with
the trinitarian doctrine.&nbsp; The Three Persons are so called
in our Western theology owing to defects inherent in human
thought and speech.&nbsp; To set one over against the other as
two parties to a contract, is to found a theory upon those very
defects.&nbsp; The Miltonic representation of the Father and the
Son is Arian; the popular view is, more often than not, a belief
either in two gods, or in a logical contradiction.</p>
<p>To sum up, the view of the Atonement with which we have been
occupying ourselves, is opposed to the fundamental moral
instincts, and to the Christian consciousness, both as it finds
expression in the New Testament, and as it reveals itself in the
best minds of to-day.&nbsp; And this type of theory, although
without some of its coarser features, is by no means
extinct.&nbsp; There is all the more need then, in spite of all
that has been so well done in this direction, to exhibit the
Atonement as the supreme vindication <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of those
instincts which are the witness of the Divine in man.&nbsp; There
is laid on all who would preach or teach Christianity to-day to
show that Calvinism, and all that is touched with the taint of
Calvinism, is not the doctrine of the Atonement which is taught
in the Bible or held by the Church.&nbsp; But, as nothing can be
built on negations, there is an even greater and more imperative
need to exhibit the truth of the Atonement in its beauty and
majesty and transcendent moral power.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The second of our two reasons for the choice of the
Cross of Christ as our subject, is the failure on the part of
those who believe in it, trust in it, and even build their lives
upon it, to realise the true vastness of its meaning.&nbsp; We
are too apt to regard the Cross as one of the doctrines of our
religion, or as supplying a motive to penitence, or to Christian
conduct.&nbsp; Our view, when we are most in earnest, is
one-sided, limited, parochial.&nbsp; We must rise, if we would
really understand the Cross, to the height of this conception:
that it contains in itself the answer to the problem of human
existence, and of our individual lives.&nbsp; The secret of the
universe, of our part of it at least, that tiny corner which is
occupied by the human race, was revealed in that supreme
disclosure of the Divine Mind which was made on Calvary.&nbsp; It
was a disclosure necessarily given under the forms of time and
space, else it could not have been given to us at all.&nbsp; But
it transcends <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>all forms and limitations, and belongs
to the spiritual and timeless order, which is also the
Real.&nbsp; But it is a disclosure which requires the thought and
study, not of one generation only, but of all.&nbsp; It can never
be exhausted.&nbsp; There is no view of it (including even that
miserable caricature which we have just considered) that is
altogether without some elements of truth.&nbsp; There is no view
which embodies the whole of the truth.&nbsp; Each generation is
meant to read that secret of God, which was uttered to mankind
from the Cross of the Christ, a little more clearly than its
predecessors.&nbsp; No theology of the Atonement which is not
both new and old, can be a true theology.&nbsp; It must be old,
because the disclosure was made under the form of historic facts
which belong to the past.&nbsp; It must be new, because each age,
in the light of the progressive revelation of God, interprets the
disclosure under the forms of its own experience, scientific,
moral, spiritual, which belongs to the present.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Therefore is every scribe that is instructed unto the
kingdom of heaven, like unto a householder which bringeth forth
out of his treasures things both new and old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the present point is, that we should realise the
far-reaching significance of the disclosure of God made on and
from the Cross.&nbsp; Human history is like a long-drawn-out
drama, in which we are actors.&nbsp; How long is that drama,
stretching back beyond the long years of recorded history to our
dim forefathers, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>who have left their rude stone
implements on the floors of caves or bedded in the river drift,
the silent witnesses of a vanished race.&nbsp; And how short is
that little scene in which we ourselves appear, while,
insignificant as it is, it is yet our all.&nbsp; And we ask, we
are impelled to ask, what is the meaning of the whole vast
drama?&nbsp; What is the meaning of our own little scene in
it?&nbsp; No questions can be compared in interest and importance
to these two.&nbsp; And the answer to them both, so we shall try
to see, was given once in time from the Cross.&nbsp; That is one
of the chief aspects under which we shall regard the Cross of
Christ, as the key which unlocks the mystery of human existence,
and of my existence.&nbsp; There is no more majestic or pathetic
conception than that of the veiled Isis.&nbsp; But the Cross is
the removal of the veil, the discovery of the Divine Secret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Before, however, we proceed to our main subject, it will be
well to set first before our minds a few elementary
considerations.</p>
<p>The existence of God appears to be necessitated in order to
account for two things: (i) the appearance of control in the
universe; (ii) the facts of moral consciousness.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; It seems impossible to get rid of the ideas of
direction and control.&nbsp; If we regard the world as it exists
at the present moment, as one stage in an age-long process, then
at least &delta;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&epsilon;&iota; the facts
which <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>now appear were contained in the earliest stage of
all.&nbsp; Man appears with his moral and spiritual nature.&nbsp;
Then already the moral and the spiritual were somehow present
when the first living cell began its wonderful course.&nbsp;
&tau;&omicron; &pi;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &omicron;&upsilon;
&mu;&epsilon;&nu; &sigma;&pi;&#941;&rho;&mu;&alpha;
&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha; &tau;&omicron;
&pi;&#941;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&nu;.&nbsp; All
movements have converged towards this end, and the co-ordination
of movements implies control.</p>
<p>This then is our first reason for our belief in God.&nbsp; We
live in a universe which seems throughout to manifest evidence of
direction and control.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; But I have much surer and more cogent evidence
within myself.&nbsp; Whence comes that ineradicable conviction of
the supremacy of righteousness, of the utter loveliness of the
good, and utter hatefulness of the evil?&nbsp; I am not concerned
with the steps of the process by which the moral sense may have
developed.&nbsp; The majesty of goodness, before which I bow,
really, sincerely, even when by my acts I give the lie to my own
innermost convictions, that is no creation of my
consciousness.&nbsp; Nor do I see good reason to believe that it
has been an invention of, or growth in, human consciousness
during the slow development of past ages.&nbsp; There is
something deeper in my moral convictions than an outward sanction
wondrously transmuted into an internal one.&nbsp; Moreover, in
the best men, those who have really developed that moral faculty
which I detect, in beginning and germ, as it were, in myself, I
see no abatement in reverence for <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the
ideal.&nbsp; Rather, the better and saintlier that they are, the
keener do they feel their fallings off from it.&nbsp; A moral
lapse, which would give me hardly a moment&rsquo;s uneasy
thought, is capable of causing in them acute and prolonged
sorrow.&nbsp; The nearer they draw to the moral ideal, strange
paradox, the farther off from them does it ever appear, and they
from it.&nbsp; It is an apostle who writes, &ldquo;Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the
chief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can I discover any tolerable explanation
of all this, except that the guiding and directive power in the
world, reveals itself in the moral consciousness of men, and with
growing clearness in proportion as that consciousness has been
trained and educated, as the moral ideal.</p>
<p>I find myself then, when my eyes are opened to the realities
of the world in which I live, confronted with the facts of
directive control and of the moral ideal.&nbsp; If I seek for
some interpretation and coordination of the facts, I am
compelled, judging of them on the analogy of my own experience
(which, being the ultimate reality I know, is my only clue to the
interpretation of the ultimate reality of the universe) to regard
them as the activities of a Person, Whom we call God.&nbsp;
Certainly to call the Ultimate Reality a Person, must be an
inadequate expression of the truth, for it is the expression of
the highest form of being in the terms of the lower.&nbsp; But it
is an infinitely more adequate presentation, than to <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>represent that Reality as impersonal.&nbsp; For
personality being the highest category of my thought, I am bound
to think of God as being Personal, if I would think of Him at
all.&nbsp; I can be confident that though my view must fall far
short of the truth, it is at least nearer to the truth and heart
of things than any other view I can form.&nbsp; It is in fact the
truth so far as I can apprehend it: the truth by which I was
meant to live, and on which I was made to act.</p>
<p>But the question of questions remains&mdash;What is the
relation of the Person Whom I call God to my own personal being,
to my spirit?&nbsp; And, in answering this question, popular
theology makes a grave and disastrous mistake.&nbsp; It regards
that Person as being isolated from all other persons, in the same
way as each of us is isolated from all other persons.&nbsp; God,
that is, is viewed as but One Person among many.&nbsp; Now,
without inquiring as to the truth of this conception of
personality, as being essentially an exclusive thing, we may at
least say this, following the teaching of our best modern
thinkers, as they have followed that of St. John and the Greek
Fathers, that God is as truly conceived of as being within us, as
external to us.&nbsp; His Throne is in the heart of man, as truly
as it is at the centre of the universe.&nbsp; No view of God is
tenable at the present day which regards Him as outside His own
creation.&nbsp; His Personality is not exclusive, but inclusive
of all <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>things and all persons, while yet it
transcends them.&nbsp; And as He includes us within Himself, as
in God &ldquo;we live and move and have our being,&rdquo; so also
He interpenetrates us with His indwelling Presence as the life of
our life.</p>
<p>To this point we shall presently return, for it is the keynote
of all modern advance in theological knowledge, so far as that is
not concerned with questions of literature, history,
arch&aelig;ology, and textual criticism.&nbsp; But we are
concerned to notice now, that this recovered truth of the
immanence of God in our humanity, affords the full and sufficient
explanation of that dark shadow which lies athwart all human
lives.&nbsp; That shadow has loomed large in the minds of poets,
thinkers, and theologians.&nbsp; The latter know it by the name
of sin.&nbsp; But what is sin save the conscious alienation and
estrangement of man from the Divine Life which is in him?&nbsp;
And if this be true, we can now see clearly why sin, moral
transgression, always makes itself felt as a disintegrating force
both without and within the individual life.&nbsp; Without, it is
for ever separating nation from nation, class from class, man
from man.&nbsp; Within, it produces discord and confusion in our
nature.&nbsp; And both results follow, because sin is the
alienation from the Divine Life, which is both the common element
in human nature which binds man to man by the tie of spiritual
kinship; and also the central point of the individual life, the
hidden and sacred source and <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>fountain of
our being, which unites all the faculties and powers of our
manhood in one harmonious whole.</p>
<p>Now the Cross of Jesus Christ is the overcoming of this
disastrous estrangement and alienation.&nbsp; It is the victory
of the Divine life in man.&nbsp; That is the most fruitful way in
which we can regard it.&nbsp; The Cross stands for
conquest&mdash;the triumph of the Divine Life in us over all the
forces which are opposed to it.&nbsp; And in this lies the glory
of the Cross; that which made the symbol of the most degrading
form of punishment&mdash;that punishment which to the Jewish mind
made him who suffered under it the &ldquo;accursed of God,&rdquo;
and which to the Roman was the ignominious penalty which the law
inflicted on the slave&mdash;the subject of boasting to that
apostle who was both, to the very heart of him, a Jew and also a
citizen of the empire.</p>
<p>The object of these lectures is to show how this is indeed the
meaning of the Cross.&nbsp; There, in Him Who was the Son of man,
the Representative and the Ideal of the race, the Divine Life
triumphed, in order that in us, who are not separate from, but
one with Him, it may win the like victory.</p>
<p>We fight against sin, and again and again succumb in the
struggle.&nbsp; But as often as with the opened eye of the soul
we turn to the Cross of Jesus, we behold there the victory, our
victory, already won.&nbsp; Already, indeed, it is ours, by the
communication to us of the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Spirit of Him
Who triumphed on the Cross.&nbsp; It only remains for us, by the
deliberate act of our whole personal being, our will, our reason,
our affections, to appropriate and make our own the deathless
conquest won in and for our humanity on the Cross.</p>

THE HISTORICAL AND SPIRITUAL CAUSES OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Him, being by the determined will and
foreknowledge of God given up, through the hand of lawless men,
ye affixed to a cross and slew.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Acts</span> <span class="smcap">ii.</span> 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Paul places this in the very forefront of that gospel
which, as it had been delivered to him, so he in his turn had
delivered to the Corinthians, that &ldquo;Christ died for our
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neglecting all, deeper interpretations of
this, it is at least clear that in the apostle&rsquo;s mind there
was the closest and most intimate connexion between the death of
Christ and the fact of human sin.</p>
<p>Now it is important to remember that that connexion was, in
the first place, an historical one.</p>
<p>Christianity is a religion founded upon facts.&nbsp; In this
is seen at once a sharp distinction between our religion and that
which claims the allegiance of so many millions of our
race&mdash;the religion, or better, perhaps, the philosophy of
the Buddha.&nbsp; Certainly there is such a thing as a Christian
philosophy.&nbsp; For we cannot handle facts without at the same
time <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>seeking for some rational explanation of them.&nbsp; The
plain man becomes a philosopher against his will.&nbsp; In its
origin our Christian theology is no artificial, manufactured
product.&nbsp; It is rather an inevitable, natural growth.&nbsp;
Neither the minds of the earliest Christian thinkers, nor our own
minds, are just sheets of blank paper on which facts may impress
themselves.&nbsp; Scientists, some of them at least, while
repudiating philosophy put forth metaphysical theories of the
universe.&nbsp; Theology is simply the necessary result of human
minds turned to the consideration of the Christian facts.&nbsp;
But it makes all the difference which end you start from, the
facts or the theory: whether your method is &agrave; posteriori
or &agrave; priori; inductive or deductive; scientific or
obscurantist.&nbsp; And Christianity follows the scientific
method of starting with the facts.&nbsp; In this lies the
justification of its claim to be a religion at once universal and
life-giving.&nbsp; It is universal because facts are the common
property of all, although the interpretation placed on those
facts by individuals may be more or less adequate.&nbsp; It is
life-giving, because men live by facts, not by theories about
them; by the assimilation of food, not by the knowledge how food
nourishes our bodies.</p>
<p>Following, then, the Christian, which is also the scientific
method, we now set out in search of the facts, the historical
causes which brought about the death of Christ.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Now these causes appear to have been, mainly, these
three: prejudice, a dead religion, and the love of gain and
political ambition.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Prejudice may, perhaps, be best defined as the
resolution to hold fast to our belief, just because it is our
belief; to adhere to an opinion, and close our eyes to all that
has been said on the opposite side.&nbsp; Now nowhere and at no
time has prejudice exerted a more absolute dominion over the
minds of men, than it did in Jud&aelig;a in the first century of
our era.&nbsp; The people had inherited a traditional conception
of the Messiah, from which they could not imagine any deviation
possible.&nbsp; He was the Deliverer and the Restorer predestined
of God.&nbsp; He would throw off the hated foreign yoke, and make
the people of God supreme over all the nations of the
earth.&nbsp; It was for a long time doubtful whether Jesus of
Nazareth intended to claim the position, and to enact the part of
the Messiah.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long keepest thou our soul in
suspense?&rdquo; was the question put to Him as late as the Feast
of Dedication, 28 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the year
before He suffered.&nbsp; But, finally, the people found
themselves confronted with a type of Messiah differing <i>toto
caelo</i> from the accepted traditional type.&nbsp; The kingdom
of God, which meant the Divine rule over the souls of men, was at
least not such a kingdom as they were looking for, as they had
been taught to expect.&nbsp; There is a long history in the
gospels of the gradual rise of a popular hope, more <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>than
once seeming to have attained its eagerly longed-for goal; but at
last doomed, and conscious that it was doomed, to bitter and
final disappointment.&nbsp; And it turned to hatred of Him Who
had aroused it from a long and fitful sleep of centuries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Crucify Him&rdquo; was now their cry.&nbsp; Jesus was put
to death on the legal charge of being &ldquo;Christ, a
King,&rdquo; a provincial rebel.&nbsp; He really died because He
was not &ldquo;Christ, a King,&rdquo; in such sense as He had
been expected to be.&nbsp; Thus the first historical cause of the
death of our Lord was prejudice, inveterate and ingrained, in the
minds of the people.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The second historical cause of the death of our Lord
was the existence in His day and place of a dead religion.&nbsp;
This is, when we consider the meaning of the phrase, the
strangest of paradoxes, the existence in fact of a logical
contradiction.&nbsp; For religion is in its essential nature a
living thing, for the very reason that it is part of the
experience of a living person.&nbsp; As experience is not merely
alive, but the sum of all our vital powers, it is ever growing,
both in breadth and in intensity.&nbsp; So far then as we are in
any true sense religious men, our religion, as part and parcel of
our experience, must be alive with an intense and vigorous
activity, growing in the direction in which our experience
grows.&nbsp; Hence a dead religion is a logical contradiction, as
we have said.&nbsp; But, as truth is stranger than fiction, so
life contains anomalies and monstrosities which simply <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>set
logic at defiance.&nbsp; A dead religion is indeed a monstrum,
something portentous, which refuses to be reconciled with any
canons of rationality.&nbsp; But it exists&mdash;that is the
astonishing fact about it; and it found its almost perfect
expression and embodiment in the normal and average Pharisee of
our Lord&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; There are three characteristic
features about a dead religion, and all of them receive a perfect
illustration in the well-known picture in the gospels of
Pharisaic religion.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; It tends less and less to rest on experience,
and more and more to repose upon tradition.&nbsp; It is academic,
a thing on which scribes may lecture, while the voice of the
scholastic pedant with blatant repetitions overpowers the living,
authoritative voice within the soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;They marvelled,
because He taught with authority, and not as the scribes.&nbsp; A
fresh (not new) teaching, with authority!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; It removes the living God to an infinite
distance from human life.&nbsp; Religion is a matter of rules, of
minute obedience to a code of morals and of ceremonial imposed
from without, not of a fellowship of the human with the
Divine.&nbsp; In fact, God is banished to a point on the far
circumference, and the centre is occupied by the Law.&nbsp; He is
retained in order to give authority to that Law, as the source of
sanctions in the way of rewards and punishments.&nbsp; In short,
the idea of the living God degenerates into the necessary
convention of an ecclesiastical tradition.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Closely connected with this second
feature is the third characteristic of a dead religion&mdash;its
inhumanity.&nbsp; When men substitute obedience to a code for
service of the living God, it is no wonder that the
truth&mdash;the central truth of religion&mdash;fades rapidly
from their minds, that the service of God is identical with the
highest service rendered to our fellow-men.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth God, love his
brother also.&rdquo;&nbsp; This explains why the Pharisee held
aloof from the outcast and the sinner.&nbsp; They might be left
to perish&mdash;it mattered not to him.</p>
<p>Now, all through the Gospel history our Lord appears as
standing in absolute and sternest opposition to the dead religion
of the Pharisees.&nbsp; He could make no manner of terms with
it.&nbsp; He acted against it.&nbsp; He denounced it at every
point.&nbsp; He rebuked them for &ldquo;making the commandment of
God of none effect&rdquo; by that tradition which they loved so
dearly.&nbsp; He brought the idea of a living God into closest
touch with the actual lives of men.&nbsp; He deliberately
consorted with publicans and sinners.&nbsp; And, finally, He
condemned, in set discourse, the whole system, traditional,
Godless, inhuman, with scathing emphasis.&nbsp; Christ died, not
only because His words and acts ran counter to the prejudice of
the people, but because He spoke and acted in opposition to the
dead religion of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The third historical cause of the death of Christ
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>was the love of gain and the political ambition of the
Sadducees.&nbsp; Their hatred, indeed, would have been powerless
if our Lord had not already provoked the enmity of the people and
of the Pharisees; but that enmity, in turn, without the
unscrupulous intrigues of the Sadducees, a small but most
influential section, would never have proceeded to its fatal and
murderous issue.&nbsp; The Pharisees gave up the conflict in
despair: &ldquo;Perceive ye that ye prevail nothing?&nbsp;
Behold, the whole world is gone after Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
the Sadducean High Priest who gave the counsel of death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is expedient that one man should die for the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must remember that the Sadducees represented the
aristocracy of Jud&aelig;a, and that, as resulted necessarily
from the nature and constitution of the Jewish state, was an
ecclesiastical aristocracy, an hierarchy.&nbsp; They are the
party denoted several times in the New Testament by the term
&ldquo;the High Priests.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nearest analogy to
their position is supplied by the political popes and bishops of
the Middle Ages.&nbsp; Their interests were political rather than
spiritual.&nbsp; A considerable amount of independence had been
left to the Jews in their own land.&nbsp; The Sanhedrin, the
native court, exercised still very considerable power.&nbsp; And
the Sadducean minority possessed a predominating influence in its
consultations.&nbsp; What political power could be wielded in a
subject state of the Empire was in their hands.&nbsp; <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Incidentally, a large and flourishing business was
conducted under their control and management in the very Temple
Courts, in &ldquo;the booths of the sons of Hanan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our Lord struck a blow at their financial interests when He drove
out these traders in sacrificial victims and other
requisites.&nbsp; But, much more, and this was the head and front
of His offence, by His influence with certain classes of the
people, and by the danger thus presented of a popular movement
which might arouse the suspicion of the imperial authorities, and
lead to very decisive action on their part, He threatened the
political position of the Sadducean aristocracy.&nbsp; So with
complete absence of scruples, but with great political sagacity,
Caiaphas uttered the momentous words, an unconscious prophecy, as
St. John points out, at that meeting of the Sanhedrin when the
death of Jesus was finally resolved upon.</p>
<p>Thus the main historical causes of the Crucifixion were these
three, prejudice on the part of the people, a dead religion on
the part of the Pharisees, love of gain and political ambition on
the part of the Sadducees.</p>
<p>We may see then how absolutely true St. Peter was to the facts
of the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him . . . through the hand of lawless
men, ye affixed to a cross and slew.&rdquo;&nbsp; God was not the
cause of the death of Jesus Christ, as in popular and ditheistic
theory, forgetting &ldquo;I am in the Father, and the Father in
Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>real causes of His Death were the
definite sins of lawless, of wicked men.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s part
was a purely negative one.&nbsp; He held His hand, and allowed
sin to work out to its fatal issue.&nbsp; The Resurrection,
indeed, is the sublime act of God&rsquo;s interference, at the
most critical point in all human history, at the one point
supremely worthy of such Divine interposition, in order to
finally and completely vindicate the cause of moral
goodness.&nbsp; But up till then, sin was allowed to have its own
way, to display fully its malign character, to reach its ultimate
result in the Death of the Sinless One.</p>
<p>But behind the historical causes of our Lord&rsquo;s death,
were deeper and spiritual causes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him being by the
determined counsel and foreknowledge of God delivered up. . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; God foreknew the result.&nbsp; There is no
difficulty here.&nbsp; But in what sense can He be said to have
&ldquo;determined&rdquo; it?</p>
<p>The answer leads us to a consideration of decisive
importance.&nbsp; God works by law, in the spiritual, no less
than in the physical region.&nbsp; The Death of the Christ, at
the hand of lawless men, came about in virtue of the working of
those laws.&nbsp; As we have said, sin is the alienation and
estrangement of man from the Divine life which is in him, and by
virtue of which he is man.&nbsp; Now, in the human character of
Jesus Christ, we see, for the first time, the perfect, genuine,
uncaricatured humanity, in which the human will is at every point
in absolute agreement and fellowship <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>with the
Divine Will.&nbsp; Shortly, He represents the complete and
absolute contradiction and antithesis of sin.&nbsp; It could not
have been, that that Life should have been realised in a world of
alienation from the Divine, without the result, which followed as
necessarily and inevitably as any of the physical happenings of
nature, of the death of the Sinless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He became
obedient unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; A deeper meaning lies in these
words of St. Paul, which contain the whole secret of the
Atonement.&nbsp; But, for the present, we may understand them to
mean, that death was the natural issue of the Life of perfect
obedience lived in a world permeated by the spirit of
disobedience.&nbsp; Thus we gain a clear knowledge of the manner
in which the death of Jesus Christ happened in accordance with
the determined counsel of God.&nbsp; That which takes place, in
the spiritual or in the physical world, as the result of the
working of those laws of God which are the constant expression of
His will, may be said to have been determined by Him.</p>
<p>There is a yet more profound meaning in the Death of Christ as
the result of sin, than any which we have as yet considered: that
Death is the outward sign and sacrament of an inward and
spiritual fact.&nbsp; When we sin we are, in a measure
proportioned to the deliberateness and heinousness of our sin,
doing to death the Divine life, the Christ within us.&nbsp; That
which happened once on Calvary is renewed <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>time after
time in the inward experience of men.&nbsp; The outward fact is
an historical drama representing an ever-repeated spiritual
tragedy.&nbsp; Daily, by the hands of lawless men, by ourselves
in our moments of wilfulness and disobedience, Christ is being
put to death.&nbsp; There is no sin which, in its measure and
degree, is not a rejection and crucifixion of the Christ.</p>
<p>The Cross of Christ, viewed in the light of its historical and
spiritual causes, is (i) the revelation of the malignity of
sin.&nbsp; There we see our favourite sins stripped of all
pleasing disguise, and revealed in their true horror, and
cruelty, and selfishness.&nbsp; The Incarnate Son of God put
Himself at the disposal of sinful men, and His violent and
shameful death was the result.&nbsp; There is the true meaning of
the sins in which we delight.&nbsp; (ii) It reveals the
disastrous result of sin, the death of the Divine Man within each
one of us.&nbsp; There is no sin which is not an act of spiritual
suicide.</p>
<p>It will not then be altogether in vain, that we have now
considered the causes of the Death of Christ if, in the
&ldquo;solemn hour of temptation,&rdquo; we, remembering the
Cross, and Him Who died thereon, and why He died, &ldquo;stand in
awe, and sin not.&rdquo;</p>

THE CHRISTIAN AND THE SCIENTIFIC ESTIMATE OF SIN</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Christ died for our sins.&rdquo;&mdash;I
<span class="smcap">Cor.</span> <span class="smcap">xv.</span>
3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more characteristic of Christianity than its
estimate of human sin.&nbsp; Historically, no doubt, this is due
to the fact that the Lord and Master of Christians died &ldquo;on
account of sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; His death was due, as we have seen,
both to the actual, definite sins of His contemporaries, and also
to the irreconcilable opposition between His sinless life and the
universal presence of sin in the world into which He came.&nbsp;
But it is with the Christian estimate of sin, and with the facts
which justify it, that we are now concerned.</p>
<p>Briefly put, Christianity regards sin as the one thing in the
world which is radically and hopelessly evil.&nbsp; Pain,
physical and mental, is evil no doubt, but in a different
sense.&nbsp; Without going deeply into the intensely difficult
problem of animal and human suffering, we may at least say this:
that he would be a bold man who would undertake to say, viewing
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>the moral results of suffering in human lives, that all,
or the majority of the instances of pain which we observe, come
under the head of those things &ldquo;which ought not to
be,&rdquo; that is, are, without qualification or extenuation,
evil.&nbsp; But this is precisely the statement which
Christianity makes with regard to sin.&nbsp; Of one thing only in
the universe can we say that it &ldquo;ought not to be,&rdquo;
and that one thing is moral evil.&nbsp; Perhaps then, broadly and
roughly, the Christian standpoint may be summed up in four words,
&ldquo;sin worse than pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of old, St. John wrote that &ldquo;if any man love the world,
the love of the Father is not in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In its outward
aspect, the world has greatly changed since these words were
written.&nbsp; And yet they are as true in the twentieth century
as they were in the first.&nbsp; The world has adopted Christian
language and manners and modes of thought.&nbsp; But always and
everywhere it is to be detected by its antagonism to the
Christian estimate of sin.&nbsp; The spirit which accuses
Christianity of gross exaggeration in this respect, is the very
spirit of the world.&nbsp; Now, as in days of long ago, when
torture and death hung on the refusal to scatter a few grains of
incense before the statue of C&aelig;sar, the same eternal choice
is presented to a man, Christ or the world?&nbsp; Which estimate
of sin are you going to make your own, the world&rsquo;s, as a
lamentable mistake, or failure, or necessity; or the Christian,
&ldquo;worse than any conceivable pain&rdquo;?&nbsp; It <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>is
not a matter of academic interest, but an intensely vital and
practical one, affecting a man&rsquo;s whole outlook upon
life.&nbsp; Which is right&mdash;there is the clear and definite
issue raised&mdash;the Christian estimate, or the world&rsquo;s
estimate of sin?&nbsp; Is it worse than a blunder, a misfortune,
a fault?&nbsp; Is it something interwoven into the very structure
of our present stage of existence?&nbsp; Or, is it an alien and
flagrant intruder into a world where it has no business, which is
so constructed that, sooner or later, wilful transgression meets
with the direst penalties?&nbsp; There is no question as to what
is the Christian estimate of sin.&nbsp; Christ or C&aelig;sar? is
the issue still presented.&nbsp; But, we wish to ask, is there
any reason for believing that the Christian estimate is
true?&nbsp; I bring forward three reasons, based respectively on
experience, on conscience, on the ultimately similar views of the
origin and nature of sin given by science and in the Bible.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; First, then, consider the argument from
experience.&nbsp; It is very easy and tempting to use the
language of exaggeration.&nbsp; But probably we are not saying
more than would be admitted by nearly every one, when we make the
assertion that a very large part of the misery and suffering
which exists in the world is traceable, directly or indirectly,
to human sin.&nbsp; We are not dealing with the results of their
own sins upon offenders, though these are in some cases
conspicuous enough.&nbsp; But that the world is <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>full of human
lives, often wrecked, more often partially stunted and spoiled,
in most cases falling short of the full measure of vitality and
happiness to which they might have attained, is a statement not
admitting of denial.&nbsp; And I think we are still on secure
ground when we say that at the root of a very large proportion of
these failures is some one of the myriad forms of sin and
selfishness.&nbsp; The strange thing, the bewildering and
baffling, although, as I believe, not wholly inexplicable thing,
is that men in a very large number of cases suffer on account of
sins for which they are in no sense responsible.&nbsp; But the
fact remains of the close connexion which experience shows to
exist between human sin and human suffering.&nbsp; It is
impossible to prove wide assertions, but a strong case could
undoubtedly be made out for the statement that sin is a more
prolific source of misery and failure in human life than all
other factors put together.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Next, we turn to the witness of conscience, of our
moral reason.&nbsp; The main point here is that so often brought
forward, of the uniqueness of remorse.&nbsp; I may make a foolish
blunder.&nbsp; I may do some hasty and ill-considered act, and in
consequence suffer some measure of inconvenience, or perhaps
experience a veritable disaster and overthrow of my hopes.&nbsp;
But in either case, though I may feel poignant regret, I am as
far as possible from the experience of remorse, save in so far as
my blunder may have involved <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>neglect of
some duty, or a carelessness morally culpable.&nbsp; But when I
have committed a sin, then it would be a most inadequate
description of my state of mind to call it regret.&nbsp; I suffer
from that intense mental pain which we have learnt to call
remorse, the constant and relentless avenger which waits upon
every transgression of the moral law.&nbsp; And when, leaving my
own experience, I interrogate the experience of men better than
myself, above all, that of the saints of God, I meet with the
same phenomenon a thousandfold intensified.&nbsp; And I have a
right in such a matter to accept the witness of the
experts.&nbsp; A saint is an expert in spiritual things, and his
evidence in spiritual matters is as cogent and trustworthy as
that of the biologist or geologist in his special field of
experience.</p>
<p>So far, then, as the witness of the moral consciousness goes,
both in myself and in those who have in an especial degree
cultivated their moral faculties, it bears out the contention
that sin is the only thing which can be described as absolutely,
without qualification, evil.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The same result follows from the consideration of the
origin and nature of sin.</p>
<p>Here we have two sources of information&mdash;modern science,
and the account given in the Book of Genesis.&nbsp; To my mind,
the enormously impressive thing is that these two sources,
approaching the same subject from entirely different points of
view, <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>find themselves at last in agreement
on the main issue.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; According to the teaching of science, then,
man is the result, the finished product, of &aelig;ons of animal
development.&nbsp; He is, in fact, the crown and so far ultimate
achievement of an age-long evolution.&nbsp; He falls into his
natural place in zoological classification as the highest of the
vertebrates.&nbsp; But also, in man we find moral faculties
developed to an immeasurably greater extent than in those animals
which stand nearest to him in physical development.&nbsp; It is
the possession of these, above all, which constitutes the
differentia of man.&nbsp; And it is this possession which makes
man, alone of all animals, capable of sin.&nbsp; For sin is
simply the following out of the instincts and desires of the
animal, when these are felt to be in opposition to the dictates
of the peculiarly human, the moral nature.&nbsp; Men have said
that the only Fall of Man was a fall upwards.&nbsp; They have
given an entirely new meaning to the medieval description of the
first transgression as the &ldquo;felix culpa.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
this would seem to involve confusion of thought.&nbsp; The first
emergence of man as man, the appearance on this planet of a moral
being, at once involved the possibility of sin.&nbsp; That, the
rise of man did necessarily include.&nbsp; An animal follows the
bent and inclination of its own nature.&nbsp; For it, sin is for
ever impossible.&nbsp; For it, there can be no defeat, no fall,
for the conditions of conflict are absent.&nbsp; But <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the
actual occurrence of sin is quite a different thing from the
appearance of a being so highly exalted as to be capable of
sinning; so constituted as to experience the dread reality of the
internal strife between flesh and spirit, the battle between the
lower and the higher within the same personal experience.&nbsp; I
can never act as the animal does, because I possess what the
animal does not&mdash;a moral nature, which I can, if I will,
outrage and defy.&nbsp; No animal can be either innocent or
guilty.&nbsp; Moral attributes cannot be assigned to it.</p>
<p>This result follows.&nbsp; When I sin, I am indeed doing what
I alone can do, because I am a man.&nbsp; But also, I am, by that
very act, contradicting my nature, violating the law of my
well-being.&nbsp; The possession of a moral nature makes me
man.&nbsp; Sin is just to act in defiance of and in opposition to
that nature.&nbsp; Sin, then, is the only possible case in the
universe, falling under our observation, in which a creature
<i>can</i> contradict the law of its being.&nbsp; Science has at
least given the final refutation of the devil&rsquo;s lie that
sin is natural to man.&nbsp; It is the only unnatural thing in
the world.&nbsp; It is not non-human, like the actions of
animals.&nbsp; The age-long history of the race can never be
reversed.&nbsp; I cannot undo the process which has made me man,
and act as the non-moral animal.&nbsp; My sinful actions, my
transgressions, are just because they are, and just in proportion
as they are, immoral, for that very reason, and in that very
measure, inhuman, not non-human.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Much more might be shown to follow from this most
important consideration.&nbsp; But here we adduce it for this
sole reason, that science may be allowed to bear its witness, a
most just and passionless, and an unconscious and tacit witness,
to the truth of the Christian estimate of sin.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Nothing, at first sight, could be more
different from the scientific account of the origin of sin, than
that account of it which is given in the third chapter of the
Book of Genesis.</p>
<p>There we have, to put it shortly, the most profound spiritual
teaching in the form of a story, a piece of primitive Hebrew
folk-lore.&nbsp; The Divine Wisdom made choice of this channel to
communicate to man certain great truths about his nature,
realities of the highest plane of his experience, where he moves
in the presence of God and realities unseen, unheard.&nbsp; And
we can discern at least some of the reasons for the choice of
these methods.</p>
<p>The most adequate revelation of the origin of sin which has
ever been made to man, must (we are almost justified in saying)
have been made to us in some such form as this for the following
reasons.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; Truth expressed in the form of a story is thereby
made comprehensible to men of every stage of culture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truth embodied in a tale, shall enter in at lowly
doors.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the door of no man&rsquo;s mind, who is
spiritually receptive, will it knock in vain.&nbsp; To simple and
to wise, to the unlearned and the learned, <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>to the young
and to the old, it appeals alike.&nbsp; This form of instruction
alone is of universal application.</p>
<p>(ii) Truth thus conveyed can never become obsolete.&nbsp;
Scientific treatises in the course of a few years become out of
date, left far behind by the rapidly advancing tide of
knowledge.&nbsp; Moreover, if we can imagine it possible that in
the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, an account
could have been composed, under some supernatural influence, in
the terms of modern thought, it would have had to wait nearly
three thousand years before it became intelligible, and then, in
a few decades, or centuries at most, it would in all probability
have become once more incomprehensible or, if not that, then at
least hopelessly behind the times.</p>
<p>The form of a story, as in the case of our Lord&rsquo;s
parables, alone ensures that truth thus conveyed shall be
intelligible to all men at all times.&nbsp; To object to the
form, to scoff at or deride it, is as unintelligent as it would
be, for example, to disparage the sublime teaching of the parable
of the Prodigal Son on the ground that we have no evidence for
the historical truth of the incidents.</p>
<p>Moreover, when we place this and the similar stories we find
in the early chapters of Genesis side by side with the Babylonian
myths with which they stand in some sort of historical
relationship, we can trace in the lofty moral and spiritual
teachings of the former, as contrasted with the grotesque and
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>polytheistic representations of the latter, the
veritable action of the Spirit of God upon the minds of
men.&nbsp; Modern research has, in fact, raised the doctrine of
inspiration from a vague and conventional belief to the level of
an ascertained fact, evidenced by observation.&nbsp; Just as a
scientific man can watch his facts under his microscope or in his
test tubes, so such comparison as has been suggested, between
Genesis and the cuneiform tablets, enables us to watch the very
fact, to detect the Divine Spirit at work, not superseding, but
illuminating and uplifting the natural faculties of the sacred
writers.&nbsp; But we now turn to the spiritual teaching
enshrined in this particular story.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; First, we have the fundamental truth that man is
made capable of hearing the Divine Voice.&nbsp; Not once in the
distant past, but to-day, and day by day, the Voice of God is
heard speaking within the depths of consciousness as clearly and
as decisively as of old it sounded among the trees of the
garden.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; But, secondly, other voices make themselves heard
by us, and woe to us if we listen to them.</p>
<p>There is the voice which bids us gratify our animal
appetite.&nbsp; The woman &ldquo;saw that the tree was good for
food.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am conscious of the strength of bodily
desires.&nbsp; Let me seek nothing, from moment to moment, but
the satisfaction of my inclinations.&nbsp; There is the voice
which bids us gratify the desire of the eyes.&nbsp; She
&ldquo;saw that the tree was pleasant to <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world is full of beauty.&nbsp; Let me make
that my end, the satisfaction of the &aelig;sthetic sense; let me
rest in the contemplation of that beauty, which was made for me,
and I for it, precisely in order that I might not find repose
there, but might be led thereby to Him Who made this scene so
fair that His dear children might be drawn to Himself, Who is the
eternal and uncreated loveliness.</p>
<p>There is, lastly, the voice which bids us gratify the desire
of the mind.&nbsp; Eve &ldquo;saw that the tree was to be desired
to make one wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; I desire to know.&nbsp; Let me
indulge this desire at any cost, even if it mean the filling of
my mind with all manner of foul and loathsome images.&nbsp; It is
all &ldquo;knowing the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; We forget, poor fools,
that mere knowledge is not wisdom, and that there is a knowledge
which brings death.</p>
<p>The desires of the body, the eyes, the mind, are good and
healthful and holy in their proper place and sphere.&nbsp;
Through these we reach out to the life and love and knowledge of
God.&nbsp; And yet, if gratified against the dictates of that
clear-sounding, inner, Divine Voice, they are precisely the
materials of sin and death.&nbsp; To gratify them against the
dictates of the moral and spiritual nature is to exclude oneself
from the garden of God&rsquo;s delight, from the health and joy
of the Divine Presence.&nbsp; We know it.&nbsp; We have learnt it
by saddest experience of our own.&nbsp; To sin against the voice
within is to find oneself separated <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>from God; the
ears of the soul have become deaf to the warnings of conscience,
the eyes of the soul blind to the vision of the glory and
holiness of God.</p>
<p>Is it wrong to say that such teaching as this can never be
outgrown?&nbsp; That, as time goes on, as the spiritual
experience of the race and of the individual grows and broadens,
still new lessons may be found to be contained in it?</p>
<p>The Bible adds to the teaching of science that without which
that teaching is incomplete.&nbsp; It bids us know and feel and
recognise the Divine Presence within us and, in the light of that
ultimate truth of ourselves, realise something of the appalling
grandeur of the issues of common life.&nbsp; But, different as
are the forms in which their respective lessons are conveyed,
science and the Bible unite their testimony to that of experience
and conscience, that the Christian estimate of sin, and not the
world&rsquo;s estimate of it, is the right one.</p>
<p>And the teaching of experience, conscience, science, and the
Bible receives its final confirmation in the Cross of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Henceforth sin, all sins, our sins, are to be
estimated and measured in the light of the fact that sin brought
about the death of the sinless Son of Man.&nbsp; Sin is the real
enemy of ourselves and of the race.&nbsp; It is the destruction
of the true self, the Divine Man in every son of man.</p>
<p>We need, for ourselves, to strive to attain to the <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>genuinely Christian estimate of sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had
they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of
Glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we have the Cross lifted up before our
eyes and when, in the light of that, we begin to hate and dread
sin worse than pain, then we shall have begun to make some real
advance towards becoming that which we long to be, and all the
time mean and aspire to be&mdash;Christians, disciples of the
Crucified.</p>

THE MEANING OF SIN, AND THE REVELATION OF THE TRUE SELF</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this we have come to know what love is,
because He laid down His life for us.&nbsp; And we ought to lay
down our lives for the brethren.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">John</span> <span class="smcap">iii.</span> 16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important that we should arrive at some clearer
understanding of the nature of sin.&nbsp; Let us approach the
question from the side of the Divine Indwelling.&nbsp; The
doctrine of the Divine Immanence, in things and in persons, that
doctrine which we are to-day slowly recovering, is rescued from
pantheism by holding fast at the same time to the Christian
doctrine of the Trinity.&nbsp; God the Transcendent dwells in
&ldquo;all thinking things, all objects of all thoughts&rdquo; by
His Word and Spirit.&nbsp; The Word, the Logos, of which St. John
speaks, is the Eternal Self-Expression of God, standing as it
were face to face with Him in the depths of His eternal
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the beginning the Word was with
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the Eternal Thought of God, Who includes
within Himself this and all possible universes.&nbsp; And the
Spirit, One with the Father and the Word, gives to the <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Thought of God its realisation and embodiment in what we
call things.&nbsp; And that realisation of the Thought of God by
the Spirit of God is a progressive realisation&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In inorganic nature, as power and wisdom and
beauty.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In organic beings, as vegetable and animal life.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In men, as the higher reason, including our moral and
spiritual nature.</p>
<p>The long process of evolution is thus the progressive
realisation of the Thought of God now becoming the Word, the
expressed Thought of God.&nbsp; And this realisation is from
within, a growing manifestation of God <i>in</i> created
things.&nbsp; And its climax was reached in the Incarnation
when</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Word became flesh; the Thought of God perfectly
embodied in our humanity.&nbsp; And now this same progressive
revelation of God is continuing on the higher plane into which it
was uplifted at the Incarnation.&nbsp; The work of the Spirit is
to form within the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, that Body
which is constituted by His indwelling, the Mind and the Life of
God Incarnate.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall take of Mine and shall show
it unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we get</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The work of the Spirit of Christ within the Church,
extending the Incarnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; writes St. Paul, &ldquo;gave Him [Christ] as
Head over all to the Church, which is His Body, the <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>fulness of Him Who at all points in all men is being
fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The application of this to our present subject is as
follows.&nbsp; The animal life in us, and the Divine life in us,
are both alike due to the indwelling God, both alike are
manifestations of His Presence.&nbsp; But they are manifestations
at two different levels of being.&nbsp; What follows?</p>
<p>The animal nature is good; the moral and spiritual nature is
good.&nbsp; What do we mean in this connexion by
&ldquo;good&rdquo;?&nbsp; We mean, they are the results of the
action of Him Whose Will is essential goodness.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of human life is, however, the conflict
between these two elements of man&rsquo;s nature&mdash;the lower
and the higher.&nbsp; Neither as yet, <i>from the human
standpoint</i>, is good or bad.&nbsp; Moral attributes belong
only to the will, which we may provisionally call the centre of
man&rsquo;s personality.&nbsp; For man is a personal being, and
as such stands apart from God.</p>
<blockquote><p>God, Whose power brought man into being,<br />
Stands as it were a handsbreadth off, to give<br />
Room for the newly made to live,<br />
And look at Him from a place apart,<br />
And use His gifts of mind and heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man alone can bring into existence the morally good or the
morally bad.&nbsp; And the materials of his choice are presented
by the co-existence within him of the lower and the higher.&nbsp;
Sin is the choice by the will of the lower, when that is felt to
be in conflict <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>with the higher.&nbsp; It is the
resolution, previous to any action, to satisfy the desires of the
animal, when these are known to contradict the dictates of the
moral and spiritual nature.</p>
<p>Here we pause to notice a point of great importance for clear
thinking on this subject.&nbsp; The conflict we have spoken of is
that described by St. Paul as between the flesh and the
spirit.&nbsp; Now the flesh is not equivalent to the body.&nbsp;
The works of the flesh are by no means necessarily sensual sins;
they include strife and envy.&nbsp; The flesh, the animal within
us, is not to be identified with our physical organisation.</p>
<p>Now we are drawing near to the very heart of the matter.&nbsp;
What is it which distinguishes the lower nature from the higher,
the animal from the Divine in us, the flesh from the
spirit?&nbsp; The distinction lies in the objects to which the
desires of each of these natures are directed.</p>
<p>The animal, predominantly, desires the good of self: the
Divine, the good of others.</p>
<p>This we must now expand.&nbsp; There is nothing morally wrong
in the self-seeking of the animal.&nbsp; Moral
evil&mdash;sin&mdash;only arises when two conditions are
fulfilled.</p>
<p>The self-seeking desire must be felt to be in contradiction to
the unselfish dictates of the higher nature.</p>
<p>The will, having this knowledge more or less <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>clearly
before it, chooses to give effect to the lower rather than to
subordinate it to the higher.&nbsp; We may express the same truth
somewhat more accurately.</p>
<p>The material of human sin is the co-existence of the animal
nature and the Divine Nature within us.</p>
<p>The occasion of sin is the conflict between the two.</p>
<p>The conditions of sin are two&mdash;knowledge and freedom;
knowledge of the antagonism between the desires of the two
natures, and freedom to give effect either to the one or to the
other.</p>
<p>The actual fact of sin is the movement of the will, making its
choice in favour of the lower in opposition to the higher.</p>
<p>These two corollaries follow:&mdash;(i) Sin belongs only to
the will, not to the nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing good
in the world save a good will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the converse is
true: there is nothing sinful in the world save a sinful
will.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; Sin does not lie in the act, but in the movement of
the will, of which the act is but the outward symbol.&nbsp; We
must carefully distinguish between sin and temptation.&nbsp; No
temptation is sinful, however strong and however vividly
presented to the mind.&nbsp; Sin only comes in when the will
makes the choice of the worse alternative.&nbsp; A sin in thought
is an act of inward choice, the deliberate indulgence of, the
dwelling with pleasure upon, the temptation presented <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to
us.&nbsp; But if I am only prevented by circumstances or by fear
from embodying the wrong choice of my will in action, I have, in
the sight of God, committed that sin.&nbsp; If I have made the
wrong choice, and am deterred by the faintest of moral scruples,
as well as, perhaps, by other considerations, from carrying it
out, I am really, although in a less degree, guilty.</p>
<p>Now we can fall back upon our main thought.&nbsp; The animal
matter is essentially self-regarding.&nbsp; This is not
(<i>a</i>) the same thing as to say that all actions of all
animals are self-regarding.&nbsp; I see no difficulty in
believing that there may be adumbrations of the moral and
spiritual in animals below man, if the animal life is the
manifestation, on a lower plane, of the same Word Who is the Life
of nature and the Light (the higher reason and spiritual life) of
man.&nbsp; Nor (<i>b</i>) is it the same thing as to say that the
desires of the animal nature are selfish.&nbsp; For selfishness
is a moral term and, as we have seen, moral attributes are
inapplicable except to a wrong choice of the will.</p>
<p>These self-regarding impulses of the animal nature are due to
the fact, that that nature is the result of the age-long struggle
for existence.&nbsp; These impulses have secured the survival and
the predominance of man.</p>
<p>But man is more than a successful animal.&nbsp; He is made in
the image of God.&nbsp; In him, the Word is <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>revealed, not
as life only, but as light.&nbsp; In an altogether higher sense
than can be predicated of any part of creation below man, he is a
sharer in the Divine life.</p>
<p>Now that Divine life is the very life of Him Whose very
essence and being is Love.&nbsp; God is Love.&nbsp; What does
this mean?&nbsp; It has never been better expressed than in the
following words: &ldquo;God is a Being, not one of Whose thoughts
is for Himself. . . . Creation is one great unselfish thought of
God, the bringing into existence of beings who can know the
happiness which God Himself knows&rdquo; (Dr. Askwith).&nbsp;
What happiness is that?&nbsp; It is explained, by the same
writer, as the happiness which is found in the promotion of the
happiness, that is, in the largest sense, the well-being of
others.</p>
<p>We can now see the reason of the antagonism between the animal
and the Divine in ourselves, the real meaning of the Pauline
antithesis between the flesh and the Spirit, the old man and the
new.</p>
<p>We are to &ldquo;put off the old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is old,
indeed, beyond our imaginations of antiquity, for he is the
product of the hoary animal ancestry of our race.&nbsp; Our
progress as successful competitors in the struggle for animal
existence, has been the waxing stronger of the old man day by
day.</p>
<p>To put on the new man, is to continue our evolution, now a
conscious and deliberate evolution, on an entirely different
plane.&nbsp; It is to subdue the self-<!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>regarding
impulses, in obedience to the movements of the Divine life within
us, which bids us deny ourselves&mdash;not some particular
desire, but our own selves&mdash;and to seek the good of others;
to seek and, seeking, surely to find, &ldquo;the happiness which
God Himself knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To put on the new man is synonymous, in St. Paul, with putting
on Christ.&nbsp; For He is the perfect revelation of the Divine
in our humanity.</p>
<p>He is this perfect revelation of the Divine self-sacrifice in
His Incarnation, when &ldquo;He became poor for our sakes,&rdquo;
when &ldquo;He emptied Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the Incarnation
is, it may well be, but the climax of the Divine sacrifice
involved in creation, when God limited Himself by His
manifestation in &ldquo;material&rdquo; things; involved, we may
say with greater certainty, in the creation of man, who can, in
some real sense, thwart and hinder the Divine Will.</p>
<p>He is the revelation of the Divine in us, in the whole course
of His earthly life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ pleased not
Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He went about doing good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, above all, He is that revelation in the supreme act of
love and sacrifice upon the Cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this have we
come to know what love is, because He laid down His life for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have come to know love, in its supreme
manifestation of itself, for ever the test, the standard of all
true love; and in coming to know love, we have necessarily come
to know God.&nbsp; The Cross is the perfect self-utterance and
disclosure <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of the Mind of God, the crowning
revelation of His Word.&nbsp; And in coming to know God, we have
come to know ourselves.&nbsp; For the true self of man is the
self conformed perfectly to the Divine Life within him.</p>
<p>Thus the Cross of Jesus Christ is the crowning revelation of
man, as well as of God.&nbsp; There, side by side with humanity
marred and wrecked and spoilt by sin, which is selfishness, we
see man as God made him, as God meant him to be, clothed with the
Divine beauty and glory of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the Cross we see ourselves, our true selves, not as we have
made ourselves, but our real and genuine selves, as we exist in
the Mind of God.</p>
<p>In the light of that wonderful revelation, we can recognise
that which is Divine and Christ-like in us, that spirit which
bids us seek not the things of self, but the things of others,
&ldquo;even as Christ pleased not Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this may be summed up in one short phrase, which goes
near, I believe, to express the innermost reality of the
Christian religion.&nbsp; Christ, the Son of man, is the true
self of every man.&nbsp; To follow Him, to be His disciple, in
thought, and word, and deed, is to be oneself, to realise
one&rsquo;s own personality.&nbsp; In no other way can I attain
to be myself.</p>
<p>Thus the Cross is the supreme revelation of the Divine Life in
man.&nbsp; And now we shall go on to see how it brings to us, not
merely the knowledge of <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the Ideal, but also, what is far
more, the very means whereby the Ideal may be realised in and by
each one of us.</p>
<p>We have dealt with the Cross as illumination; we now approach
its consideration as redemptive power.</p>

THE GREAT RECONCILIATION</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God was in Christ reconciling the world
unto Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 <span class="smcap">Cor.</span>
<span class="smcap">v.</span> 19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such considerations as we have had before us, are of far more
than theoretical interest.&nbsp; They are of all questions the
most practical.&nbsp; Sin is not a curious object which we
examine from an aloof and external standpoint.&nbsp; However we
regard it, to whatever view of its nature we are led, it is,
alas, a fact within and not merely outside our experience.</p>
<p>And so we are at length brought to this most personal and most
urgent inquiry, What has been the result <i>to me</i> of my past
acts of sin?&nbsp; I have sinned; what have been, what are, what
will be the consequences?</p>
<p>The most hopelessly unintelligent answer is, that there are no
results, no consequences.&nbsp; It behoves us to remember that we
can never sin with impunity.&nbsp; This is true, even in the
apparent absence of all punishment.&nbsp; Every act of sin is
followed by two results, though probably a profounder analysis
would show them to be in reality one.</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>(i)&nbsp; Whenever I sin I inflict a definite injury on
myself, varying with the sinfulness of the sin; that is, with its
nature and the degree of deliberation it involved.&nbsp; I am
become a worse man; I have, in some degree, rejected and done to
death the Divine in me, my true self.&nbsp; Every sin, in its own
proper measure, is both a rejection of the Christ within, and
also an act of spiritual suicide.</p>
<p>Again (ii), each sin, once more according to the degree of its
guilt, involves separation from God.&nbsp; And, as union with God
is life, it follows that sin is, and not merely brings
death.&nbsp; That is the death of which the outward, physical
death is the mere symbol.&nbsp; It is death of that which makes
me man&mdash;the weakening of my will, the dulling of my
conscience, the loss of spiritual vision.&nbsp; Hereafter, it may
be, all this will be recognised by me as being death indeed, when
I see how much I have missed, by my own fault, of the life and
happiness which might have been mine in virtue of that unbroken
communion with God, for which I was made.</p>
<p>These two results may be regarded as the penalties of sinning;
more truly, they are aspects of sin itself.&nbsp; We can hardly
be reminded too often that the worst punishment of sin is sin
itself.&nbsp; The external results of sin, where such occur, are
not evil, but good; for the object for which they are sent is the
cure of sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;To me no harder hell was shown than
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; If hell is this separation from God, this
veritable and only <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>real death, then hell is not an
external penalty inflicted upon sin, but is involved in the very
nature of sin itself.&nbsp; Or, it would be still more accurate
to say, the constitution of the universe (including ourselves)
being what it is, and the nature of sin being what it is, these
results necessarily follow.</p>
<p>Now, the universe is not something which God has created and
then, as it were, flung off from Himself, standing for ever
outside it, as it is for ever outside Him.&nbsp; The universe, at
each moment of its existence, is the expression, in time and
space, of the Divine Mind.&nbsp; What we call its
&ldquo;laws,&rdquo; whether in the physical or the spiritual
sphere, are the thoughts of the Mind of God: its
&ldquo;forces&rdquo; are the operations of the Will of God,
acting in accordance with His thoughts: material
&ldquo;things&rdquo; are His thoughts embodied, that is, Divine
thoughts rendered, by an act of the Divine Will, accessible to
our senses.</p>
<p>Now we are in a position to understand both what is meant by
the Wrath of God, and the manner in which it acts.</p>
<p>By the expression, &ldquo;the Wrath of God,&rdquo; we are to
understand the hostility of the Divine Mind to moral evil: the
eternal antagonism of the Divine righteousness to its
opposite.&nbsp; We are not now dealing with the question of the
real or substantive existence of evil.&nbsp; But revelation amply
confirms and enforces the conviction of our moral consciousness
that, with a hatred beyond all human measures of hatred, God <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>hates sin.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to add, that
that eternal and immeasurable hatred and hostility of the Divine
Mind towards sin is compatible with infinite love towards His
children, in whose minds and lives sin is elaborated and
manifested.&nbsp; In fact, all attempts to reconcile the Wrath of
God with His love seem to be utterly beside the mark.&nbsp; They
only serve to obscure the truth that the Divine Wrath is itself a
manifestation of the Divine Love.&nbsp; For if sin is, as we have
already seen, in its very essence, selfishness, and if Love is
the very Being of God&mdash;if He is not merely loving, but Love
itself&mdash;then the Wrath of God, His hostility to sin, is His
Love viewed in one particular aspect, in its outlook on moral
evil, in its relation to that which is its very opposite and
antithesis.&nbsp; Hell and Heaven, separation from God and union
with Him, are alike expressions of the Eternal Love, which,
because it is love, burns with unquenchable fire against all
forms of selfishness and lovelessness.</p>
<p>This is the true, the ultimate reason why, in a universe which
is the expression of the Mind of God, we cannot sin, and never
have sinned, with impunity.</p>
<p>From these two fundamental truths&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; The universe is the expression of the Mind of
God;</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; God is love,</p>
<p>There follow, by a natural and inevitable law, the two results
which accompany every act of sin.</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; The destruction of the true self, the
Christ, the Divine Life within man.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Separation from God, which is death.&nbsp; We
separate these results in thought; but it will now be
sufficiently obvious that they are, in fact, one.</p>
<p>Is this taking too serious a view of sin?&nbsp; I do not think
that this can be maintained in view of our whole preceding
argument.</p>
<p>But are we taking too serious a view of little sins, of sins
which spring from ignorance, of the sins of children?</p>
<p>We have already seen that knowledge and freedom are both
necessary to constitute an act of sin.&nbsp; If ignorance is
complete, then complete also is the absence of sin.&nbsp; For sin
lies not in any material act, but in consciousness and
will.&nbsp; The will alone can be sinful, as the will alone can
be good.&nbsp; And it is entirely consistent with our standpoint,
to admit the existence of an almost infinite number of degrees of
sinfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Now we reach this immensely important result.&nbsp; We having
sinned, our supreme need is forgiveness.&nbsp; The Gospel of
Jesus Christ is a Gospel for this precise reason, that it meets,
as it claimed from the beginning to meet, this uttermost need of
men.&nbsp; Its offer is, always and everywhere, the forgiveness,
the remission of sins.</p>
<p>But what are we to understand by forgiveness?&nbsp; <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>The
forgiveness which is offered to us in the name of Jesus Christ is
not, and our own moral sense ought to assure us that it could not
be, the being let off punishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt call
His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their
sins,&rdquo; not from any external pains or penalties of their
sins.&nbsp; To be saved from sin, is to have sin brought to an
end, abolished within us.&nbsp; It is the recovery of the true
self, the restoration of that union with God which is, here and
now, eternal life.&nbsp; In other words, understanding the Divine
Wrath as we have seen reason to understand it, forgiveness must
mean to cease to be, or to cease to identify ourselves with, that
in us which is the object of the Divine Wrath.&nbsp; In short,
forgiveness is, in the great phrase of St. Paul, reconciliation
with God.</p>
<p>How, then, is forgiveness or reconciliation to be
obtained?&nbsp; The answer which the apostle gives is this:
&ldquo;God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us try to see what this means.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There can only be one way of ceasing to be the object of the
Divine Wrath, and that is by identifying oneself with it; if we
may use the catch-phrase, by becoming its subject instead of its
object.&nbsp; This means that, so far as is in our power, we must
enter into the Divine Mind in regard to sin, and our own sins in
particular.&nbsp; Up to the limit of our power, we must make that
Mind our own <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>mind, we must hate sin, and our sins,
as God hates them.</p>
<p>There is one word in the New Testament which expresses all
this, and that is the word only partially and inadequately
translated &ldquo;repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word thus
represented is
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;, and
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha; is exactly
&ldquo;a change of mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; It really means the coming
over to God&rsquo;s side, the entire revolution of our mental
attitude and outlook with regard to sin.&nbsp; The word stands
for self-identification with the Wrath of God, with the Divine
Mind in its outlook upon sin.&nbsp; That change of mind is itself
reconciliation, forgiveness, remission of sins.&nbsp; And that
which alone makes
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha; and,
therefore, forgiveness, possible, is the Death of Jesus Christ
upon the Cross.</p>
<p>For that Death is the perfect revelation, in the only way in
which it could be interpreted to us, that is, in terms of our
common human life, of the Wrath of God, the Divine hostility to,
and repudiation of sin.&nbsp; For the Death of Christ was the
complete repudiation of sin, by God Himself, in our
manhood.&nbsp; The Incarnate Son laid down His life in the
perfect fulfilment of the mission received from the Father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He became obedient unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died,
rather than, by the slightest concession to that which was
opposed to the Divine Will, be unfaithful or disobedient to that
mission.&nbsp; &ldquo;He died to sin once for all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His Death was His final, complete repudiation of sin.&nbsp; And
thus it was the absolutely <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>perfect
revelation of the Divine Mind in regard to sin.</p>
<p>This is the truth which underlies all the utterly misleading
language about Christ&rsquo;s Death as a penalty, or about Christ
Himself as the Ideal Penitent.&nbsp; Both penalty and penitence
imply personal guilt and the personal consciousness of
guilt.&nbsp; Both conceptions destroy the significance of the
Cross.&nbsp; Only the Sinless One could die to sin, could
perfectly repudiate sin, could perfectly disclose the Mind of God
in relation to sin.</p>
<p>The Death of Christ was indeed, as we have seen, the result of
His perfect obedience in a world of sin, of disobedience.&nbsp;
The historical conditions under which He fulfilled His Mission,
necessitated that His repudiation of sin should take the form
which it did actually take.&nbsp; We may be sure, too, that He
felt, as only the Sinless Son of God could feel, the injury, the
affront, the malignity, the degradation of sin.&nbsp; It is the
sense of this which has given rise to the modern idea of Christ
as the Penitent for the world&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp; But if we are to
understand the word in this sense, then we are entirely changing
its meaning and connotation.&nbsp; And we cannot do this, in
regard to words like penitent and penitence, without producing
confusion of thought.&nbsp; It is time, surely, that this
misleading and mischievous fallacy of the penitence of Christ
should be finally abandoned by writers on the Atonement.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>But, so far, we have only seen that the Death of Christ
to sin, His repudiation of sin to the point of death, is the
complete revelation of the Divine Wrath, the Divine Mind in
regard to sin.&nbsp; If we could only make all this our own, then
we should have actually attained to the changed mind, the
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;, which is
reconciliation with God.</p>
<p>Now, it is a most significant fact that, in the New Testament,
repentance is ever closely coupled with faith.&nbsp; Faith, in
its highest, its most Christian application, is not faith
<i>in</i> Christ, in the sense of believing that the revelation
made by Christ is true, but in the strange and pregnant phrase of
St. Paul and St. John, faith <i>into</i> Christ.&nbsp; And by
this is meant entire self-abandonment, the utter giving up of
ourselves to Christ.&nbsp; To have faith into Christ is the
perfect expression of discipleship.&nbsp; It is the supreme act
of self-surrender by which a man takes Christ henceforth to be
the Lord and Master of his life.&nbsp; It implies, no doubt, the
existence of certain intellectual convictions; but the faith
which rests there is, as St. James tells us, the faith of the
demons &ldquo;who also tremble.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the full sense,
faith is an act of the whole personal being.&nbsp; And as the
will is our personality in action, we may say that faith into
Christ is, above all, an affair of the will.</p>
<p>But thus to surrender oneself to Christ, to make Him, and not
self, the centre and governing principle of our life is, in other
words, to make His Will our <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>will, His
Mind our mind.&nbsp; St. Paul is exactly describing the full
fruition and final issue of faith when he says of himself,
&ldquo;I live, yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith <i>is</i> self-identification with the Mind of
Christ.&nbsp; And that Mind is the Mind of Him Who died to sin,
Who by dying repudiated sin, and revealed His implacable hatred
of and hostility to it, which is the hatred and hostility of God,
in our manhood, to the moral evil which destroys it.</p>
<p>Thus the man, who, by the supreme act of faith into Christ,
has made Christ&rsquo;s Mind his own mind, has thereby gained the
changed mind, the
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;, in regard to
sin, which is the ceasing to be the object of God&rsquo;s wrath,
because it is the being identified with it.&nbsp; He is,
henceforth, reconciled to God.&nbsp; The state of alienation and
death is over.&nbsp; In Christ he, too, has died to sin.&nbsp;
The false self, in him, has been put to death.&nbsp; With Christ
he has been crucified.&nbsp; With Christ he lives henceforth to
God, in that union and fellowship with Him, which is the life
eternal, the life which is life indeed.&nbsp; His true self, the
Christ in him, is alive for evermore in the power of the
Resurrection.</p>
<p>That is the final issue, the glorious consummation, of
faith.&nbsp; But so far as faith is in us at all, so far as daily
with more complete surrender we give ourselves to Christ, and
take Him for our Lord and Master, the process, of which the
fulfilment, the perfect end, is <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>reconciliation, union, resurrection, eternal life, has
begun in us.&nbsp; And He Who has, visibly and manifestly,
&ldquo;begun in us&rdquo; that &ldquo;good work,&rdquo; will
assuredly &ldquo;accomplish it until the day of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But something more yet remains to be said.&nbsp; Every theory
of the Atonement in the end must come to grief, which is based
upon the assumption that Christ is separate from the race which
He came to redeem, or the Church, which is the part of humanity
in actual process of redemption.&nbsp; Professor Inge, in his
work on <i>Mysticism and Personal Idealism</i>, has justly
denounced the miserable theory which regards human personalities
as so many impervious atoms, as self-contained and isolated
units.&nbsp; This popular view is theologically disastrous when
the Atonement is interpreted in the light, or rather the darkness
of it.</p>
<p>As the Son of man He is the Head of the human race, &ldquo;the
last Adam&rdquo; in the language of St. Paul.&nbsp; No mere
sovereignty over mankind is denoted by that title.&nbsp; He is
that living, personal Thought of God which each man, as man,
embodies and, with more or less distortion, represents.&nbsp; He
Who became Incarnate is, as He ever was, the Light which
lighteneth every man coming into the world.</p>
<p>It was because of this, His vital and organic connexion with
the race, and with every member of it, that He could become
Incarnate, and that His sufferings and triumph could have more
than a pictorial, <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>or representative, or vicarious
efficacy.&nbsp; His work of redemption was rendered possible by
His relation, as the Word, to the whole universe, and to
mankind.</p>
<p>It was because of this, that He could become &ldquo;the Head
of the Body, the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Former ages interpreted the
Atonement in the terms of Roman law.&nbsp; It is the mission of
our age to learn to interpret it in terms of biology.&nbsp; We
are only just beginning, by the aid of modern thought, to
discover the true, profound meaning of the biological language of
the New Testament.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the body is one, and has many
members, so also is the Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not, let us mark,
the Head only, but the Body.&nbsp; The Church is &ldquo;the
fulness of Him Who at all points, in all men, is being
fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words tell us of an organic
growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the vine, ye are the
branches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can any terms express organic connexion
more clearly than these?</p>
<p>It is our Head, to Whom we are bound by vital ties, in the
mysterious unity of a common life, Who has repudiated sin by
dying to it.&nbsp; By personal surrender to Christ we make His
Mind our own; but we are enabled to do so, because, in so doing,
we are attaining to our own true mind, we are entering into the
possession of our own true selves, we are &ldquo;winning our
souls,&rdquo; realising the Christ-nature within us.&nbsp; By
faith and sacraments, that which is potentially ours becomes our
own in actual fact.</p>
<p>In simpler language, and in more familiar but not <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>less
true words, we who are members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, in all our
weak attempts after repentance and faith, are not left to our own
unaided resources, but are at every point aided and enabled to
advance to final, complete reconciliation and union by the Spirit
of the Christ working in us.</p>
<p>He is no merely external reconciler.&nbsp; He reconciles us
from within, working along with our own wills, to create that
changed mind which is His own Mind revealed upon the Cross for no
other reason than that it might become our mind, the most real
and fundamental thing in us, that &ldquo;new man, which is being
renewed after the image of Him Who created him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver from the body

</blockquote>
<p>We have studied the meaning of reconciliation through the
Cross.&nbsp; We have said that to be reconciled to God means to
cease to be the object of the Wrath of God, that is, His
hostility to sin.&nbsp; We can only cease to be the objects of
this Divine Wrath by identifying ourselves with it, by making
God&rsquo;s Mind in regard to sin, and our sins, our own
mind.&nbsp; The Cross gives us power to do this.&nbsp; For it
reveals to us in the terms of humanity, that is, in the only way
in which it could be made intelligible to us, the Divine Mind in
its relation to sin.&nbsp; By faith, which is personal surrender
to Christ, His mind thus revealed becomes our mind.&nbsp; Thus we
attain to &ldquo;repentance,&rdquo; in the New Testament sense of
the changed mind and outlook upon sin.&nbsp; And the motive power
to faith and repentance is supplied by our union with Christ.</p>
<p>But all this is not yet enough.&nbsp; We have not exhausted
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>the glory, the full meaning of the Cross.&nbsp; If this
were indeed all, the work of our salvation would be
incomplete.&nbsp; For I may indeed have, in Christ, died to sin;
in Him I may have repudiated it; but the task of life still lies
before me to be fulfilled, and that task is nothing short of
this: the complete putting off of sin, the complete putting on of
holiness, the final achievement of that union with God which is
life eternal.</p>
<p>For this I was made.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye shall therefore be
perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
Lord is not, in these words, enunciating a rule of perfection for
a few saintly souls.&nbsp; He is laying down the law, the
standard of all human lives.&nbsp; To fall short of this, is to
fall short of what it means to be a man.</p>
<p>The proof that this is so, is to be found in our own
consciousness, bearing its witness to these words of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; The one most constant feature in human life is its
restlessness, the feeling of dissatisfaction which broods over
its best achievements, the attainment of all its desires.&nbsp;
That very restlessness and dissatisfaction is the witness to the
dignity of our nature, the grandeur of our destiny.&nbsp; We were
made for God, for the attainment of eternal life through union
with Him.&nbsp; No being who was merely finite, could be
conscious of its finitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spite of yourselves ye witness this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who blindly self or sense adore.<br />
Else, wherefore, leaving your true bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still restless, ask ye more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our heart
knoweth no rest, till it find rest in Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then look at the other picture.&nbsp; Side by side with the
glory of our calling, place the shame and the misery of what we
are.&nbsp; My desires, my passions are ever at war with the true
self, and too often overcome it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see another law
in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing
me into captivity to the law of sin and death which is in my
members.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so there goes up the bitter cry,
&ldquo;Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
of this death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Cross of Jesus Christ is the Divine answer to this
great and exceeding bitter cry of our suffering, struggling,
sinful humanity.&nbsp; For the Cross is not merely an altar, but
a battlefield, by far the greatest battlefield in all human
history.&nbsp; That was the crisis of the conflict between good
and evil which gives endless interest to the most insignificant
human life, which is the source of the pathos and the tragedy,
the degradation and the glory, of the long history of our
race.&nbsp; It is the human struggle which we watch upon the
Cross: the human victory there won which we acclaim with endless
joy and exultation.&nbsp; Man faced the fiercest assault of the
foe, and man conquered.</p>
<blockquote><p>O loving wisdom of our God!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all was sin and shame,<br />
A second Adam to the fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the rescue came.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>O wisest love! that flesh and blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which did in Adam fail,<br />
Should strive afresh against the foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should strive, and should prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man conquered man&rsquo;s foe, and in the only way in which
that foe could be conquered, the way of obedience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He became obedient unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Death was
in a real sense the victory, for its only meaning and value
consisted in its being the crown and culmination of His life-long
obedience.&nbsp; The Resurrection itself, in one aspect of it,
was but the symbol, the &ldquo;sign,&rdquo; of that victory which
was already achieved upon the Cross.</p>
<p>But what has this to do with us?&nbsp; It cannot be too often
repeated, that it has nothing to do with us, if Christ be merely
&ldquo;Another,&rdquo; separate from us as we are, or imagine
ourselves to be, separate from each other.&nbsp; That which He
took of the Virgin Mary, and took in the only way in which it
could have been taken, by the Virgin Birth, was not a separate
human individuality, but human nature; that nature which we all
share.&nbsp; It was in that nature that He faced and overcame our
enemy.</p>
<p>Here we pause to note a difficulty based on a
misunderstanding.&nbsp; If Christ were a Divine Person, working
in and through human nature, if that humanity which He assumed
were itself impersonal, then how could He have had a human
will?&nbsp; And, after all, is an impersonal human nature really
human?&nbsp; That is the difficulty, and the very fact <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>that
we feel it as a difficulty, is a proof that we have not yet
grasped that conception of the Divine Nature which underlies the
belief in the Incarnation.&nbsp; God and man are not beings of a
different order.&nbsp; The humanity of every man is the
indwelling in him of the Word Who became flesh.&nbsp; Each one of
us is a shadow, a reflection of the Incarnation.&nbsp; In Jesus
Christ God came; and, it would be equally true to say, in Him
first, man came.&nbsp; All human nature, I believe it would be
true to say all organic nature, pointed forward to the
Incarnation as its fulfilment, as the justification for its
existence.</p>
<p>Thus, when it is said that the human nature of Christ was
impersonal, what is meant is, impersonal in the modern and
restricted sense of personality.&nbsp; The phrase is useful, when
explained, to guard against the idea, which is contrary to the
very principle of the Atonement, that the Son of man was just one
more human soul added to the myriads of human souls who have
appeared on this planet.&nbsp; He Who became Incarnate is the
true self of every man, the very Light of true personality in all
men.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, He was more truly humanly
Personal than any of the sons of men, and all the more truly
humanly Personal, because He was Divinely Personal, the Word in
the image of Whom man was made.</p>
<p>The immense significance of these truths in regard to our
redemption is this, that a separate individuality <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>cannot be imparted to us, but a common nature can.&nbsp;
And that nature which the Eternal Word assumed of the Virgin
Mary, and in which He conquered sin and death, is communicated to
us by His Spirit, above all, in the sacraments of Baptism and the
Holy Communion.&nbsp; Here is the heart of the Atonement.</p>
<p>That victory over sin and death is mine, and yet not
mine.&nbsp; That is the splendid paradox which lies at the very
root of Christianity.&nbsp; It is mine, because I share in that
Human Nature, which by its perfect obedience, the obedience unto
death, &ldquo;triumphed gloriously&rdquo; upon the Cross.&nbsp;
It is not mine until, by a deliberate act of my will, in
self-surrender to Christ, I have made it my own.&nbsp; By grace
and by faith, not by one of these without the other, we become
one with Him Who died and rose again.&nbsp; It is faith, the hand
of the soul stretched out to receive, which accepts and welcomes
grace, the Hand of God stretched out to give.</p>
<p>These great thoughts we will pursue in our next address.&nbsp;
But meanwhile, we have at least seen that the Cross is both
victory and attainment: victory over the sin by which I have been
so long held in bondage; attainment of all I can be, all I long
to be, all I was made by God to be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks be to God
through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We were made for holiness, union with God, eternal life.&nbsp;
These are but different expressions for one and the same
thing.&nbsp; For holiness is the realisation of our manhood, of
that Divine Image which is the true self, expressing itself and
acting, as it does in us, through the highest of animal
forms.&nbsp; That perfect self-realisation is not merely
dependent upon, but is union with God, at its beginning,
throughout its course, and in its final consummation.&nbsp; And
the life of self-realisation or holiness, which is the life of
union with God, is eternal.&nbsp; Eternal life is not, as in the
popular idea of it, an endless and wearisome prolongation of mere
existence.&nbsp; Primarily, the idea is of the quality, not the
duration of life.&nbsp; In the teaching of the New Testament,
eternal life is a present possession of Christians.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These things I write to you, who believe on the Name of
the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being as it is a moral and spiritual <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>reality, it is outside time and space.&nbsp; It is
unaffected by &ldquo;changes and chances.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is for
ever beyond the reach of the temporal processes of decay,
corruption, death.&nbsp; Here it manifests itself in service,
that service of our fellows which is the service of God.&nbsp;
Hereafter, it will be manifested in higher and more exalted forms
of service.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have thou authority over ten, over five,
cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all this, the consummation and glorious fruit of our
humanity, holiness, union with God, life eternal, we see already
realised in Jesus Christ, the Son of man.&nbsp; We see it
realised, as we have learnt, not in a separate, solitary,
individual, isolated life, but in that common nature which
&ldquo;for us men and for our salvation&rdquo; He assumed of the
Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>All that is in Him was in Him first, in order that it might be
in us.&nbsp; And this is the important point: it can only be in
us by virtue of our union with Him.&nbsp; That union He describes
under the vivid and forcible metaphor of eating His flesh, and
drinking His blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that eateth My flesh, and
drinketh My blood, hath life eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; His flesh and
blood&mdash;a common Jewish phrase for human nature&mdash;is
precisely that common nature which He assumed, in which He died
to sin, which He raised from the dead and exalted to the Right
Hand of God, and which He imparts to us, by His Spirit given to
dwell in us for evermore.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>The doctrine of the Atonement is incomplete, it is
irrational, until it is completed by the doctrine of the Spirit,
the Giver of Life.&nbsp; As He is the source of life in all
living organisms, so He is in Christians the source of the
Christ-life.&nbsp; He comes to dwell in us, not simply as the
Spirit, but as the Spirit of Christ&mdash;the Spirit Who first
created, and then &ldquo;descended&rdquo; to abide in the Perfect
Manhood.&nbsp; That gift of the Spirit of Christ as the
indwelling source of the life of Christ, and the means of the
Presence of Christ in us, is the characteristic gift of the New
Dispensation.&nbsp; It is His work to make us ever more and more
partakers of Christ, to be perpetually feeding us with His flesh
and blood.</p>
<p>And, as we are about to speak of the Holy Communion, it is
well to insist first on this, that the work of the Spirit in
there feeding us with the flesh and blood of the Son of man is a
continuous process.&nbsp; It is of the very essence of what is
meant by being a Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man have not the
Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sixth
chapter of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel is not a mere prediction of
the Eucharist.&nbsp; It is the revelation of that principle of
which the Eucharist is an illustration.&nbsp; Our Communions are
the supreme moments, the crises, in a process which is for ever
going on, the feeding of us, by the Spirit, with the flesh and
blood, the holy and victorious manhood, of the Redeemer.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>What relation, then, can this spiritual process have to
the material substances, to the bread and wine which are used in
the Eucharist?&nbsp; This question at once opens out into the
larger one, as to the relation between matter and spirit.&nbsp;
Now, that question could not be dealt with at all satisfactorily
without undertaking a vastly larger task than we are prepared for
at the present moment.&nbsp; We should have to ask, What is,
after all, meant by &ldquo;matter,&rdquo; and what by
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But something may be achieved on a much humbler scale.&nbsp;
It will suffice for our present purpose to concentrate our
attention on a remarkable fact which seems to underlie all our
experience.&nbsp; And we will approach the statement of this fact
by first recalling the familiar definition of a sacrament, which
fastens upon the union of the outward and visible with the inward
and invisible as being the essence of what is meant by a
sacrament.&nbsp; Now, the fact we have in view is this:
<i>every</i> outward object in the world is, in this respect, a
sacrament.&nbsp; What we seem to see is everywhere spirit working
through what we call &ldquo;material&rdquo; objects.&nbsp; That
sacramental principle of the universe is the very principle which
underlies our Lord&rsquo;s parables of Nature.&nbsp; Speaking
more accurately, we see in &ldquo;matter&rdquo; (1) the means of
the self-revelation of spirit; (2) the instrument by which spirit
acts.</p>
<p>The human organism may serve as a type of this.&nbsp; <!--
page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Here is a spiritual being, the Ego, in its will, its
thoughts, its affections, invisible, and it makes its presence
manifest, and it acts, through the material manifestation and
instrument of itself, the body.&nbsp; To believers in God, nature
itself, in its deepest reality, is the revelation of the Divine
Presence, and the instrument of the Divine action.&nbsp; A
beautiful sunset is a veritable and genuine sacrament.&nbsp; In
the light of this profound truth, of matter as the manifestation
and instrument of spirit, we are enabled to see how futile was
the ancient dispute concerning the number of the
Sacraments.&nbsp; In view of the fuller and larger knowledge
which has come to us, this, like so many other objects of
theological strife, ought before this to have been consigned to
the limbo of forgotten controversies.</p>
<p>But in all this we have been, in fact, interpreting the whole
universe in the light of the Incarnation.&nbsp; For that is the
supreme sacrament of all, the very type and complete embodiment
of the sacramental principle.&nbsp; There we see the Divine
manifesting Itself through, and using as the instrument of its
action, a Human, a &ldquo;material&rdquo; Body.</p>
<p>The Eucharist thus for the first time becomes
intelligible.&nbsp; It is only one particular illustration,
although a most momentous one, of the universal sacramental
principle, of which all things else in the world are also
illustrations.&nbsp; There we have the Spirit manifesting itself
and acting, <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>as always and everywhere, wherever
&ldquo;matter&rdquo; is found; but in a particular way, and for a
particular purpose.</p>
<p>The bread and the wine are the material substances which He
uses at the critical moments in His perpetual action of feeding
us with the flesh and blood of the Son of man.&nbsp; And these
elements were obviously chosen, &ldquo;ordained by Christ
Himself,&rdquo; for their most significant symbolism.&nbsp; There
is no truer philosophy of the Eucharist than that which is
contained in the familiar words of the Church Catechism, which
speak of &ldquo;the strengthening and refreshing of our souls by
the Body and Blood of Christ, as our bodies are by the bread and
wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; That wonderful, and in itself essentially
sacramental process, by which the organism lives by the
incorporation and assimilation into its own substance of other
substances which we call foods, is the exact analogue of the way
in which our true, spiritual manhood lives by the incorporation
and assimilation of the manhood of Christ, that manhood which is
holy, which exists in the Divine Union, which has perfectly
realised eternal life in the complete dying to sin, and the
complete putting on of holiness.</p>
<p>The Eucharist is, in the broadest sense, the final act in the
drama of our salvation.&nbsp; It is the means by which, by His
own appointment, all that Christ achieved <i>for</i> us upon the
Cross, the repudiation of, or dying to sin, the realisation of
perfect obedience, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>obedience unto death, comes to be
<i>in</i> us, is made all our own.</p>
<p>But it is most important that we should ever remember that
this truth has two sides.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; It is Christ Who saves us; that is, Who is the
actually putting away of sin, attainment of holiness, union with
God, eternal life, by what He does in us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ
<i>for</i> us&rdquo; finds its perfect fulfilment and end in
&ldquo;Christ <i>in</i> us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; Yet, Christ does not save us apart from
ourselves.&nbsp; Else the Eucharist would be degraded to the
level of some heathen, magical charm.&nbsp; We must will and
intend the putting off of sin, and the putting on of
holiness.&nbsp; We must recognise, and this is a truth of
experience, our complete inability to attain this without
Him.&nbsp; That will, and that recognition, are the repentance
and faith which constitute the necessary contribution on our part
to the work of Christ for our salvation.</p>
<p>Our Communions are the most important moments in our
lives.&nbsp; Each marks a distinct and definite stage in the
fulfilment of the purpose of God for us, the fulfilment in us of
all that is meant by the Death and Resurrection of the
Lord.&nbsp; We ought to come, therefore, not only after due
preparation, with repentance and faith, but also with hope and
joy; not to perform a duty, but to receive the best gift which
God Himself can bestow upon us&mdash;that gift which is the
perfect conquest of sin, the complete realisation <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>of
holiness, union with God, eternal life; the fulfilment of every
aspiration, the accomplishment of every dream, the achievement of
every glory, the crown, the consummation, the attainment of our
manhood in union with Jesus Christ the Son of man.</p>

THE SACRIFICE</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and
the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God, purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living
God?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heb.</span> <span
class="smcap">ix.</span> 13, 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No Christian doctrine is more commonly misunderstood than that
of the sacrifice of Christ.&nbsp; This misunderstanding arises
from ignorance as to the meaning of sacrifices in the ancient
world.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is one of the earliest and most widely spread of all
human institutions.&nbsp; Behind the laws regulating sacrifice in
the Old Testament there lies the long history of Shemitic ritual
and religion.&nbsp; These sacrificial rites were not then
introduced for the first time.&nbsp; They formed part of the
inheritance of the Israelites from their far-off ancestors; an
inheritance shared by them with the Ammonites and Edomites, and
other kindred and neighbouring nations.&nbsp; They differed from
these not in matter or form, but in the loftier moral and
spiritual tone which formed the peculiar and distinguishing mark
of the Hebrew religion, and in which we to-day can <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>clearly trace the actions in the minds of men of the
Spirit of God.</p>
<p>It follows that it is hopeless to attempt to understand the
sacrificial teaching of the Old Testament without some grasp of
the meaning of sacrifice in the ancient world.&nbsp; Failure to
attain this has led to the idea that the sacrifice of Christ must
mean the appeasing of an offended Deity by blood and death.&nbsp;
But this view of sacrifice is not merely a heathen, but a late
and debased heathen conception.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I give my
first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin
of the soul?&rdquo; was the cry of the King of Moab, and it marks
the lowest depth into which the pagan idea of sacrifice had
sunk.&nbsp; It is a genuine instance of deterioration in ethnic
religion.&nbsp; The primitive view was far loftier and more
spiritual than this.</p>
<p>Recent researches, dependent on the comparative method, into
the earliest forms of religion have brought to light two
principles which underlay the conception of sacrifice, and which
to a great extent can be discerned more clearly in the most
ancient period than in later times.&nbsp; Now these two
principles which, taken together, constitute the primitive theory
of sacrifice, which make up the fundamental idea of it, however
little prehistoric man may have been capable of giving distinct
and logical expression to them, were these:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Death is necessary to the attainment of the fulness
of life.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>2.&nbsp; Man is, by his very nature, capable of sharing
in, becoming a partaker of, the Divine life.</p>
<p>The earliest known form of sacrifice is the killing of the
sacred animal of the tribe, the animal which was held to be the
representative of the tribal god, followed by the sacred tribal
meal upon the victim.&nbsp; There, in this earliest <i>totem</i>
rite, we have already implicit the two great ideas of sacrifice,
the communion of man with God by actual participation in the
Divine life (the feast on the sacrifice), and that this communion
is rendered possible by the death of the sacred victim.</p>
<p>These ideas were very largely obscured in ancient times by the
conception of sacrifice as a gift, a tribute, or a
propitiation.&nbsp; But these ideas, though they bulk largely in
modern minds unacquainted with the recent researches of
specialists in comparative religion, were, in fact, of later
growth.&nbsp; They are accretions which, by a very natural and
intelligible process, have overlain the oldest and really
fundamental ideas which lie at the root and origin of
sacrifice.</p>
<p>These two ideas were, however, present all through, in what we
might perhaps call (without committing ourselves to any
psychological theories) the racial subconsciousness.&nbsp; They
were always there, ready to be evoked by the appropriate
stimulus, whenever applied.&nbsp; They constituted the real
essence and meaning of the ancient mysteries, which from <!--
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> downwards formed so
important a part of the real religion of the ancient world, and
which have left their mark on the language of St. Paul and other
early Christian teachers.&nbsp; These mysteries, roughly and
broadly speaking, were of the nature of a religious
reformation.&nbsp; They represented the discarding of the
propitiatory idea in favour of the original meaning of sacrifice
as communion.</p>
<p>These earliest notions of sacrifice really underlay the
sacrifices of the Old Testament, especially in the case of the
peace offerings.&nbsp; But, in these, we become conscious of a
third element, the conviction that sin is a barrier to the Divine
Communion.&nbsp; When the worshipper, in the sin-offering, laid
his hands upon the head of the victim, he was, by a significant
action, repudiating his sin, and presenting the spotlessness of
the victim as his own, his own in will and intention
henceforth.&nbsp; The blood was sprinkled upon the altar as the
symbol of the life offered to and accepted by God; it was
sprinkled upon the worshipper as the sign of the communication to
him of that pure Divine life, by virtue of his participation in
which man can alone approach God.</p>
<p>All this can be summed up in one word,
&ldquo;symbolism.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the value of ancient
sacrifices, including those of the Old Testament, lay wholly in
the moral and spiritual truths which, in a series of outward and
significant actions, they stood for and symbolised.&nbsp; <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>To attach objective value to that which was external in
the Old Testament sacrifices, or even to the outward
accompaniments of the Supreme Sacrifice, the Death of Jesus
Christ upon the Cross, is to be guilty of a relapse from the
Christian, or even the prophetic spirit, into the late and
debased pagan idea of sacrifice, from which the ancient mysteries
of the Eastern and Greek world were a reaction.&nbsp; Certainly,
the outward sufferings of our Lord should sometimes form the
subject of our thoughts as a motive, and one of the strongest
motives, to penitence and love.&nbsp; But to lay such stress on
these as to exalt them into the real meaning of the sacrifice of
Christ, as constituting its value as a sacrifice, to regard them
as in some way changing the Mind of God towards us, is contrary
to the whole spirit of the New Testament.&nbsp; What the real
teaching of the gospels is in the matter, is made plain by two
significant facts.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; While it is quite clear that the inspired writers
regard the Death of Christ, and the Christian life, as being,
each of them, in a real sense, a sacrifice, direct sacrificial
language is applied sparingly to the former, but without stint or
hesitation to the latter.&nbsp; This is a point which has been
strikingly brought out by Professor Loftus in his recent work on
<i>The Ethics of the Atonement</i>.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; While devoting a large portion of their narrative
to the account of the Death of Christ, they exercised a very
great and marked reserve as regards <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the physical
details of the Crucifixion.&nbsp; In this respect the gospels are
in harmony with the earliest Christian representations, as
distinguished from the repulsive realism in which the medieval
artists revelled.</p>
<p>To ask, then, in what sense the Death of Christ was a
sacrifice, is to ask how far that Death realised the moral and
spiritual truths which underlay the ancient institution of
sacrifice, and to which all sacrifices ultimately pointed.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first of these ideas, as we have seen, is that
death is necessary to the fulness of life, that life can only be
won by the surrender of life.&nbsp; That ancient conception
constitutes the fundamental teaching of Christ: &ldquo;He that
willeth to save his life, shall lose it, and he who willeth to
lose his life . . . shall save it unto life eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And of that great truth, which is nothing less than the formative
principle of the Christian life, the Cross was the supreme
expression &ldquo;Herein have we come to know what love is,
because He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down
our lives for the brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laying down of life, self-sacrifice, of which the Cross is
the highest manifestation, alone brings life, alone is
fruitful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except a grain of corn fall into the earth
and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selfishness, whether as self-assertion or self-seeking, is
essentially barren and unproductive, both in <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>regard to the
lives of others and our own lives.&nbsp; Only so far as we are,
in some real sense, laying down our lives for others, denying
(not that which belongs to us, but) ourselves, for their sake,
can we hope to influence other persons for good, to be the cause
of moral fruitfulness, of spiritual life in them.&nbsp; And for
ourselves, we only win the fulness of our own lives, so far as we
lose them in the lives of others, so far as we identify ourselves
with their joys, sufferings, interests, pursuits, well-being; for
our lives are real, and rich, and full exactly in proportion to
the extent to which they include the lives of others.</p>
<p>And the Death of Christ ceases to be an unintelligible
mystery, when it is regarded as the consummation of His Life of
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ also pleased not
Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He went about doing
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at last, in the fulfilment of a mission
received of the Father for the good of men, His brethren, He
crowned the Life, in which self-pleasing was not, by His Death,
the necessary result, as we have seen, of His carrying out that
mission in a world of sinful men.&nbsp; For Himself, that Death
was, so He willed, the portal to the glory of the
Resurrection.&nbsp; And the fruits of His uttermost
self-sacrifice are still, after all these centuries, being
gathered in, as in innumerable souls brought back from the
darkness of sin into the light of the Divine Life, &ldquo;He sees
of the travail of His soul, and is satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But what answers, in the Death of Christ, to <!--
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>that in regard to which the death of the victim served
but as a means to an end, the sacred meal of communion?&nbsp; The
sacrificial principle has been laid down by the writer of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, &ldquo;without shedding of blood, there
is no remission.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blood to the modern mind speaks of
death, and usually of a violent and painful death.&nbsp; To the
ancient mind, heathen or Israelite, blood stood for and
symbolised life.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Blood makes atonement by the
Life that is in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man can only be made at one with
God, can only have &ldquo;remission of sins&rdquo;&mdash;the
barrier which sin interposes to communion with God can only be
removed, he can only be restored to that Divine fellowship for
which he was made&mdash;by actual reception into himself of the
Divine life, of the life of Him Who, being God, became man, in
order to impart His own Divine Life to our humanity which He
assumed.&nbsp; And Christ&rsquo;s Life only then became available
for men, capable of being imparted to each man, when it had
passed through Death to Resurrection.&nbsp; If the grain
die&mdash;only if it die first&mdash;&ldquo;it bringeth forth
much fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I go not away, the Comforter,
the Paraclete, will not come unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only by
virtue of that &ldquo;going away&rdquo; of Christ, which includes
His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension, could the Spirit which
indwells His glorified manhood, come to impart the life of Christ
to the members of the Body of Christ.&nbsp; Pentecost is the
final consummation of man&rsquo;s atonement and redemption.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>We may still more briefly summarise these two
fundamental principles which constitute the sacrificial aspect of
the Death of Christ.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Christ died, not that we should be excused from
offering, but that we might be enabled to offer the one
acceptable sacrifice to God, that is, the sacrifice of ourselves
in that service of God which is the service of our
fellow-men.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Christ died, in order that we might receive His
Divine Life into ourselves, through the indwelling Spirit of
Christ bestowed by the Ascended Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the Death of Christ is not merely a sacrifice, one out of
many, or (as has been so mistakenly taught) simply the last of a
series.&nbsp; It is rather the one sacrifice which alone realises
the ideas of which all other so-called sacrifices were but the
faint adumbrations.&nbsp; As the one true sacrifice it stands at
the end of an age-long spiritual evolution.&nbsp; In the physical
evolution, the first protoplasmic cell was not man, though it
pointed forward to man, and implied man.&nbsp; So the
<i>totem</i> feast and the old Jewish rites, were not truly and
genuinely sacrifices, though both pointed forward to and implied
the realisation of sacrifice in the Death of Christ.&nbsp; That
Death was the fulfilment of the universal human aspiration, the
assurance of the truth of that ancient dream of mankind, that man
was capable of being, and might attain to be &ldquo;partaker of
the Divine nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this whole teaching of ancient ritual as fulfilled <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>and accomplished on the Cross of Jesus Christ, is summed
up for us in our Christian Eucharist where on the one hand we, in
union with the sacrifice of Christ, &ldquo;offer and present
ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and
living sacrifice &ldquo;to God; and, on the other hand, by eating
the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of man, become
partakers of Him Who, in the words of St. Athanasius, &ldquo;was
made man, that we might be made God,&rdquo; became partaker of
our human nature, in order that we might realise the end of our
manhood, by being made partakers of His Divine Life.</p>

86</span>THE DEVOTION OF THE THREE HOURS</h2>
<h3>I<br />
INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS</h3>
<p>The object with which we meet here can be expressed in a
Pauline phrase of three words, it is &ldquo;to learn
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, in those three words, there is contained, in the manner
of St. Paul, a wealth of meaning.&nbsp; To learn Christ is
clearly an affair of the intellect, in the first place.&nbsp; It
quite certainly, in this sense, does not mean merely to
accumulate information regarding the words and acts of our
Lord.&nbsp; St. Paul himself is singularly sparing of allusions
to the history of Christ, if we exclude from that His Death,
Burial, and Resurrection.&nbsp; The phrase, in fact, describes
that kind of knowledge to which a detailed study of the
Saviour&rsquo;s Life is related as means to an end, the
knowledge, namely, of Christ&rsquo;s character, of His Mind and
Will.&nbsp; Such knowledge is not to be acquired in one hour or
in three.&nbsp; It is, it ought to <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>be, the
life-long object of a Christian man to gain it in an
ever-increasing measure of fulness and accuracy.&nbsp; But the
last words of the Lord, the seven sayings from His Cross,
constitute a special and in some measure unique disclosure of His
Mind and Will.&nbsp; And, therefore, to meditate upon them, as we
are now proposing to do, will be to advance one stage further,
and a distinct stage, in the process of &ldquo;learning
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; But we do well to remind ourselves, at the very
outset, that our aim is not merely intellectual, but also
practical.&nbsp; There is no real gain arising from the knowledge
of Christ&rsquo;s Mind and Will, save so far as that knowledge
enables us to make that Mind and Will our own mind and our own
will.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is the very meaning of Christian
discipleship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The end thus set before us is one capable of
attainment by all.&nbsp; The individual, indeed, cannot hope to
realise that end completely by himself.&nbsp; The embodiment of
Christ&rsquo;s Mind and Will is the supreme task and the final
achievement of the whole Body of Christ.&nbsp; The purpose of the
long development of the Church on earth is, that &ldquo;we should
<i>all</i> (not <i>each</i>) arrive at a perfect man, at the
measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The whole Church, the Body in its completeness, is meant to
reflect back in the eyes of the Father, the moral glory of the
Son of man.&nbsp; Each individual has been <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>called into
membership in the Body, in order that he might reflect some one
of the scattered rays of that glory; might embody in himself one
aspect of the infinite perfection of the Son of man.&nbsp; So
would each of us truly &ldquo;come to himself,&rdquo; realise all
that he is capable of becoming.</p>
<p>That progress of the Body of Christ towards its goal is
described by St. Paul as being a growth of the Christ
Himself.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;at all points in all men being
fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a true and important sense in
which the Incarnation is as yet incomplete, in which the
life-history of the Church is its growing completeness.&nbsp; Our
individual task is the realisation in ourselves of that part of
the Christ life which we, individually, have been created to
embody.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It will be useful to sum up the Character, the Mind
and Will of Christ, in a single phrase.&nbsp; Consider how He
impressed His contemporaries.&nbsp; What was it which they saw in
Him, who knew Him best, and had been united to Him by close ties
of comradeship and discipleship?&nbsp; In one word, what they saw
was Sonship.&nbsp; &ldquo;We beheld His glory, as of an
Only-Begotten from a Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mind and Will of
Christ are the perfect realisation of the Divine Sonship in our
humanity.</p>
<p>But what is the meaning of God&rsquo;s Fatherhood and
man&rsquo;s sonship?&nbsp; The ultimate truth of the
relationship, the truth which underlies all such conceptions as
care, love, obedience, is community of <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>nature.&nbsp;
Our human nature is really akin to the Divine.&nbsp; We are sons
of God because our spiritual life is of one piece with His as
derived from it.&nbsp; Baptism introduces no new element into our
nature.&nbsp; By sacramental union with the Only Begotten, the
Ground and Archetype of all sonship, it enables us to realise
that which is in us, to actually become that which, potentially,
we are.&nbsp; It gives us &ldquo;power to become children of
God,&rdquo; to attain the meaning of our manhood, to regain our
true selves.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Baptism gives power, all sacraments give power, but
in such wise that that power is useless, even, <i>in a sense</i>,
non-existent, till we make it ours by deliberate exertion, by
co-operation of mind and heart and will with the Divine in
us.</p>
<p>The end of our living, to become truly and completely the sons
of God, is to be attained by the joint action of two
factors&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The Spirit of Christ conforming our minds and wills
more and more to the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; The co-operation of our whole personality with the
work of the indwelling Spirit.</p>
<p>Our meditations this morning on the Seven Words in which
Christ made some partial disclosure of His Mind and Will, will
form some part of that co-operation, one little stage in the
accomplishment of our life-long task.</p>
<h3><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

THE FIRST WORD</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">St. Luke</span>
<span class="smcap">xxiii.</span> 34.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; Here we are watching the behaviour of the Son of God,
the Ideal and Ground of Divine Sonship in humanity.</p>
<p>Is this supreme example of forgiveness an example to
<i>us</i>?&nbsp; Is it not something unnatural to humanity as we
know it?</p>
<p>We must recall, from a former address, the distinction which
we then drew between the animal in us, with its self-assertive
instincts, and the Divine in us, that which constitutes us not
animal merely, but human, of which the very essence is the
self-sacrifice of perfect love.&nbsp; Christ came to reveal God
in our manhood.&nbsp; And I need this revelation, just because
the animal in me has won so many victories in the past over the
Divine, because in me the spiritual fire habitually burns so low
and dim.</p>
<p>It is a very different thing to say that forgiveness of all
serious injury is a hard thing.&nbsp; It is hard, but not
impossible.&nbsp; That which makes it to be possible <!-- page
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>is
the serious intention of discipleship, co-operating with the
indwelling Spirit of Christ transforming us into His
likeness.</p>
<p>To assert, on the other hand, that forgiveness of serious
wrong is impossible, is to ignore the fact that He Who uttered
these wonderful words is the true self of me, and of every man
who breathes.&nbsp; He Who hung on the Cross, and spoke these
seven words, is the Son of man, the Representative to all ages,
to all varieties of human character, of true humanity.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Christ-like forgiveness is no weak thing, but the
strongest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Yet, for its true effect to be produced, its true character
must be recognised.&nbsp; No suspicion of cowardice or impotence
must cleave to it.&nbsp; The man who being obviously able to
resent an injury, and not lacking in the capacity of resentment,
yet for Christ&rsquo;s sake forgives, exercises on earth no
inconsiderable share of the moral power of Christ.&nbsp; God now,
as of old, &ldquo;has made choice of the weak things of the
world,&rdquo; those things which the world accounts weak,
&ldquo;to confound the strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
meek&rdquo; still &ldquo;inherit the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are dealing, all through, with the injury which is
personal, with the resentment which is the reaction of the
individual against unprovoked wrong.&nbsp; Personal resentment we
are bidden to relentlessly crush out&mdash;&ldquo;to turn the
other cheek&rdquo; is the command of Christ.&nbsp; But the
Christian man will recognise <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>that the
interests of the social order are not to be disregarded.&nbsp;
These interests, and those of the offender himself, will
sometimes demand that the wrong, even if it primarily affects
ourselves, shall not go unpunished.&nbsp; Again, no one can be in
the full sense a Christian, that is, a fully developed man, or a
man on the way to the full development of his nature, who is
without the capacity of moral indignation, in whom no flame is
kindled by the oppression of the weak.</p>
<p>What the Christian moral law does demand of us, is the
complete suppression of the merely personal anger which sometimes
burns so fiercely in us when we receive unmerited insult or
injury.&nbsp; That kind of anger belongs to &ldquo;the
flesh,&rdquo; is part of the defensive equipment of the animal
nature.&nbsp; Before we can in any sense be Christ-like, the
spirit must win many hard-won victories over its ancient foe.</p>
<p>To say &ldquo;I will forgive, but I can never forget,&rdquo;
is only to conceal from ourselves the defeat of the spiritual
man, the Christ in us.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But carefully note the reason appended to the prayer:
&ldquo;they know not what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is true,
with every variety of degrees and shades of truth, of every
sinner.&nbsp; It was true, clearly, of the soldiers then
performing their duty: it was less true, but still in a real
sense it was true, of the Pharisees, of the High Priests, of the
Roman judge.&nbsp; It is true, but to a far less degree, even of
us, that when we sin, we &ldquo;know not what we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Sins are, in the language of St. Paul, works of
darkness.&nbsp; That is the element in which alone they can
exist.&nbsp; Sin is a huge deception.&nbsp; The very condition of
its existence is the concealment of its true character.&nbsp; All
this is summed up in that experience which we call
&ldquo;temptation.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are so familiar with sin, the
atmosphere we breathe is so infected with it, we have given way
so many times in the past, that it needs the objective revelation
of the Cross to bring home to us the real horror and malignity of
sin.&nbsp; It has been finely said, &ldquo;Sin first drugs its
victims before it consumes them.&rdquo;&nbsp; We, too, or some of
us, have known the strange petrifying, hardening effect of sin on
the conscience.</p>
<p>Great, then, is our need that we should pray that the
revelation of the Cross may more and more come home to us; great
our need to pray for an ever fuller measure of that Spirit of
Christ, Whose first work it is &ldquo;to convince the world of
sin,&rdquo; to make men realise its true character and its
inevitable issue.</p>

<p>We judge of any power by the results which it effects.&nbsp;
We gain some knowledge of the power of steam by its capacity to
drive a huge mass of steel and wood weighing twenty thousand tons
through the water at the rate of twenty knots an hour.&nbsp;
There we have some standard by which we can gauge the force which
sends our earth round the sun at twenty-five miles a second, or
that which propels a whole solar system through space.&nbsp; But
we may apply the same method, of estimation by results, to the
powers of the moral and spiritual worlds.&nbsp; Judged thus, it
was indeed a stupendous power which was exerted by Christ from
the Cross.&nbsp; For what result can be more amazing than the
reversal, at the last, of the character slowly built up by the
habits of a lifetime?&nbsp; It is, of course, useless to
speculate on the antecedents of the robber (not
&ldquo;thief&rdquo;) who turned to our Lord with the words,
&ldquo;Jesus, remember me when Thou shalt come into Thy
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know only what is implied by <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the
word &ldquo;robber&rdquo; or &ldquo;brigand,&rdquo; and the fact
that he had joined, with his fellow-sufferer, in the mockery of
our Lord.&nbsp; But the words thus addressed by him to Christ, in
their context, represent the most wonderful
&ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; of human life, a genuine and
thorough-going conversion.&nbsp; And the power which wrought that
stupendous result was the patience and forgiveness of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; The weak things had, as so often since, confounded
the strong.&nbsp; In His matchless forbearance, in the prayer for
His executioners, the royalty of Christ our Lord was disclosed,
and the &ldquo;title&rdquo; over His head was vindicated.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; First then, we learn from the Second Word the Mind
and Will of God towards penitence.&nbsp; There is no interposing
of delay.&nbsp; Forgiveness is instantaneous.&nbsp; No pause
intervenes between the prayer for pardon, and the pardon
itself.&nbsp; But, that instant response was to genuine
&ldquo;change of mind,&rdquo; not to the repentance which is
merely regret for the past, still less to a cowardly shrinking
from a deserved punishment, but to a definite act of the
man&rsquo;s will, repudiating sin, and ranging himself on
God&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The rejection of sin, the identifying of
self with God&rsquo;s attitude towards it, that, we have seen, is
alone, in the New Testament sense of the word, repentance.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The penitence of the robber, on analysis, discloses
the three familiar elements&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Contrition is obviously implied in the whole
action.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Confession&mdash;&ldquo;we receive the
due rewards of the things which we wrought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Amendment&mdash;in the separation of himself
from those with whom he had hitherto joined in reviling
Christ.</p>
<p>Now it is worth noting, that our Catechism bids us examine
ourselves not about our sins, but about our repentance;
&ldquo;whether they truly repent.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are meant to
ask ourselves&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Is our contrition real?&nbsp; And here, for
our comfort, we remember that God accepts as contrition the
sincere desire to be contrite.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Have we made such a painstaking
self-examination as to ensure our making a good confession?&nbsp;
&ldquo;If we confess our <i>sins</i>&rdquo; (separate, detailed
sins, not our sinfulness in general terms), &ldquo;He is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have we used &ldquo;sacramental&rdquo; confession, according
to the teaching of the Prayer Book, that is, when our conscience
told us that we needed it?</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Is our resolution of amendment a clear and
honest one?&nbsp; What sins are there, some of whose results we
are able to modify or in part reverse (false impressions,
untruths, acts or words of unkindness)?&nbsp; God is generous in
forgiveness.&nbsp; Surely we are bound to be generous in our
amendment.&nbsp; There is a sense in which the results of sin
abide beyond possibility of recall.&nbsp; Yet I believe that the
instinct which bids us &ldquo;make up for&rdquo; a hurt inflicted
on a beloved person, <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>is a Divine instinct in our nature,
and one which we are to carry into the region of our relation to
God.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We notice another important truth as regards the
Divine forgiveness.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the removal
of punishment, the release from penalty or consequence of
sin.&nbsp; The forgiveness of the robber was immediate and
complete.&nbsp; But he had still to hang in agony, and there
awaited him the frightful pain of the crurifragium, the breaking
of the legs by beating with clubs.</p>
<p>The sooner we learn the two great truths about the punishment
of sin, the better.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Punishment is inevitable.&nbsp; It is a
necessary result of the constitution of the physical and moral
universe, of the working, in both regions, of those laws which
are the expression of the Divine Mind.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Punishment is remedial.&nbsp; Many Christian
theologians have fallen far below Plato&rsquo;s conception of
God, as One Who can only punish men with a view of making them
better.</p>
<p>Think of one of the punishments of repented sin, the haunting
memories of past evil.&nbsp; In this case, both principles are
very clearly discernible.&nbsp; Each recollection may be made the
means of a renewed act of rejection of sin, and thus become an
opportunity for the deepening of repentance.</p>
<p>And what disclosure does this second word contain of the Mind
and Will of God in us, as manifested not towards, but by
ourselves?&nbsp; Our lesson is <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the prompt
recognition and welcome of any, even the slightest signs of
amendment.&nbsp; It may be our duty to punish.&nbsp; It is always
our duty to keep alive, or to kindle, the hope in an offender of
becoming better.&nbsp; In that hope, alone, lies the possibility
of moral amendment.&nbsp; There is the golden rule, laid down by
St. Paul for all who have to exercise discipline over others, in
words which ring ever in our ears&mdash;&ldquo;lest they be
discouraged.&rdquo;</p>

THE THIRD WORD</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lady, behold thy son.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Behold thy mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. John xix.</span> 26, 27.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this Word we see the Son of God revealed as human son, and
human friend, all the more truly and genuinely human in both
relations, because in each and every relation of life,
Divine.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first lesson in the Divine Life for us to learn
here is the simple, almost vulgarly commonplace one, yet so
greatly needing to be learnt, that &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; which
is but a synonym of the Divine Life, &ldquo;begins at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Home life is the real test of a person&rsquo;s
Christianity.&nbsp; There the barriers with which society
elsewhere hedges round and cramps the free expression of our
individuality, no longer exist.&nbsp; We are at liberty to be
ourselves.&nbsp; What sort of use do we make of it?&nbsp; What
manner of self do we disclose?&nbsp; Would our best friends
recognise that self to be the person whom they admire?&nbsp; If
we are to be Christians at all, we must begin by being Christians
at home.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>At home, and beyond the limits of home, one great
Christian virtue stands out as the supreme law of social
behaviour&mdash;that is, for a disciple&mdash;the virtue of
consideration for others.</p>
<p>In the midst of torturing physical pain, in the extreme form
of that experience, of which the slightest degree makes us
fretful, irritable, self-absorbed, our Lord calmly provides for
the future of His mother and the disciple whom He loved.</p>
<p>What is required of us is not high-flown sentiment, but the
practical proof of consideration, that we have really learnt the
first lesson of the Christ-life, to put others, not self, in the
first place.&nbsp; The proof, the test, is our willingness to put
ourselves to inconvenience, to go without things, for the sake of
others.&nbsp; If in such a little matter as so ordering our
Sunday meals as to give our servants rest, as far as may be, and
opportunity for worship, our practical, home Christianity breaks
down, then we must not shirk the plain truth, there is in us
<i>nothing</i> of the Spirit of Him Who spoke the Third
Word.&nbsp; On the other hand, the readiness with which we do
yield up our comforts is a proof&mdash;nothing short of
that&mdash;a proof of the indwelling of God in us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In this we know that He abideth in us, from the
Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;the Spirit of the Christ&mdash;&ldquo;which
He hath given to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We notice, in the second place, that Christ&rsquo;s
proof of friendship is the assignment of a task, the giving of
some work to do for Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold thy <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are His friends, as He Himself
has told us.&nbsp; &ldquo;No longer do I call you slaves, for the
slave is one who knows not what his master is doing; but you I
have called friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. John had forsaken his
Friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a torchlight
and a noise,<br />
The sudden Roman faces, violent hands,<br />
And fear of what the Jews might do,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>had been too much for the disciple&rsquo;s courage and the
friend&rsquo;s devotion.</p>
<blockquote><p>And it is written, I forsook and fled:<br />
That was my trial, and it ended thus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But St. John had returned.&nbsp; There he is, in his true
place, beside his Master and Friend.</p>
<p>We too have forsaken, sometimes denied, the same Master and
Friend.&nbsp; We too with true repentance have returned, and are
struggling to take up the old allegiance.&nbsp; What is the
proof, where is the assurance for which we long more, perhaps,
than for anything else in the world, that our repentance has been
accepted, that we are once more in the number of those whom He
calls His friends?</p>
<p>There is one decisive test.&nbsp; Upon all His friends He lays
some task.&nbsp; If we have anything to do for Jesus Christ, then
we may assure our hearts.&nbsp; Our desertion has been
forgiven.&nbsp; He has spoken to us the words of peace,
&ldquo;Behold thy mother, thy brother, thy son.&rdquo;&nbsp; For,
let us not forget, all work for others, for the bodies, the
minds, the souls of our brethren <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>in the
family of God, is capable of being raised from the level of
professional drudgery, and of becoming the direct service of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>To work for Christ is the real foretaste of heaven, far
removed from the sensuous imagery of some modern hymns.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be thou ruler,&rdquo; there is the supreme reward,
&ldquo;over ten cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are doing any work for Christ, i.e. for others for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, and as part of our service to Him, willingly
and cheerfully, then we have the final and convincing proof that
we are indeed forgiven, that the offer of renewed allegiance has
been accepted, that we have been restored to His Friendship.</p>

THE FOURTH WORD</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Matt.</span>
<span class="smcap">xxvii.</span> 46; <span class="smcap">St.
Mark</span> <span class="smcap">xv.</span> 34.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three peculiar and distinguishing features of this
fourth word which our Saviour uttered from His Cross.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It is the only one of the Seven which finds a place
in the earliest record of our Lord&rsquo;s life, contained in the
matter common to St. Matthew and St. Mark.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is the only one which has been preserved to us in
the original Aramaic, in the very syllables which were formed by
the lips of Christ.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is the only one which He is said to have
&ldquo;shouted&rdquo;
(&epsilon;&beta;&omicron;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;&nu;), under the
extremity of some overpowering emotion.</p>
<p>In fact, we are here at the very heart of the Passion.&nbsp;
In this dread cry I see something of the height of the Divine
love, something of the depths of my own sin.</p>
<p>The meaning of this dread &ldquo;cry&rdquo; is not perhaps so
difficult to understand as some have thought.&nbsp; It is to be
found in the entire reality of that human nature <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>which the Son of God assumed&mdash;not merely a human
body, but a human consciousness like our own; in the thoroughness
with which He identified Himself with every phase of our
experience, the knowledge of personal sin alone excepted.</p>
<p>In this identification more was involved than we commonly
think.&nbsp; Sin cannot be in a world of which the constitution
is the expression of the Mind of God, without introducing therein
a fatal element of discord, confusion, and pain.&nbsp; To all
consequences of sin the Saviour necessarily submitted Himself, by
the mere fact of His entry into a world which sin had
disordered.&nbsp; In respect of the external consequences, this
is abundantly clear.&nbsp; We have seen, and it is, in fact,
obvious, that His sufferings and Death were the result of the
actual sins of men.&nbsp; But there were, it is important to
remember, internal sufferings attributable to the same
cause.&nbsp; We are at once reminded of His tears over the doomed
city, doomed by the persistent refusal to recognise the Divine
voice.&nbsp; But we are here on still deeper ground.&nbsp; The
true explanation of the fourth word is to be found in that great
principle which St. Paul has laid down in a familiar, but little
understood, sentence: &ldquo;the sting of death is
sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simplest and most obvious meaning of these words is that,
whatever be the physiological meaning and necessity of human
death, its peculiar horror and dread, that which makes death to
be what it is <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>for us, is to be found in sin, in
the separation of man from God.</p>
<p>Now that horror consists, ultimately, in the fact that death
is the analogue, or, in New Testament language, the
&ldquo;sign,&rdquo; of what sin is&mdash;separation.&nbsp; If sin
is, essentially, the violent and unnatural separation of man, by
his own act, from his spiritual environment, death is clearly the
separation&mdash;and, <i>as our sins have made it</i>, the
violent and unnatural separation of man from all that has
hitherto been his world.&nbsp; It may be, that the final,
extremest pang of death is the supreme moment of agony, when we
feel that we are being made to let go our hold on reality, are
slipping back into what, in our consciousness of it, must appear
like nothingness, the mere blank negation of being.&nbsp; Here,
then, we have the explanation of this awful cry.&nbsp; He Who
came &ldquo;for our salvation&rdquo; into a world disordered by
sin, willed so to identify Himself with our experience, as to
realise death, not as it might have been, but as man had made it,
the very sign and symbol of man&rsquo;s sin, of his separation
from God.&nbsp; That moment of extreme mental anguish wrung from
His lips the Cry, not of &ldquo;dereliction,&rdquo; but of faith
triumphing even in the moment when He &ldquo;tasted death&rdquo;
as sin&rsquo;s most bitter fruit, &ldquo;<i>My</i> God, why didst
Thou forsake Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What this view involves is briefly</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; Death is an experience natural to man.</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>(ii)&nbsp; Sin has added to this natural experience a
peculiar agony, a &ldquo;sting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp; This &ldquo;sting&rdquo; is an experience of utter
isolation at some moment in the process of death, the feeling
that one is being violently rent away from one&rsquo;s clinging
hold of existence.</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp; This &ldquo;sting&rdquo; is due to the disorder sin
has introduced into the constitution of the world and of man.</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp; In virtue of this, death has become the
&ldquo;sign&rdquo; in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; world of what sin
is in the spiritual.</p>
<p>(vi)&nbsp; Our Blessed Lord so utterly identified Himself with
our experience, with the internal as well as with the external
consequences of our sin, as to undergo this most terrible result
of man&rsquo;s transgression.</p>
<p>(vii)&nbsp; And He felt the full agony of it as realising,
what none but the Sinless One could realise, the horror of sin as
separation from God.</p>
<p>In a word, the Cry represents the culmination of our
Lord&rsquo;s sufferings, a real experience of His human
consciousness.</p>
<p>The experience was &ldquo;objective,&rdquo; as all states of
consciousness are.&nbsp; Our sensations are as objective as
&ldquo;material things.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, as we have just
said, real: inasmuch as the only definition of reality is that
which is included in personal experience.</p>
<p>Thus understood, this fourth word teaches us at least two
valuable lessons.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It discloses to us the Mind of Christ, which is to
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>be our own mind, in its outlook upon human sin.&nbsp;
We, if &ldquo;the same mind&rdquo; is to be in us &ldquo;which
was also in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; must hate sin, and our sins, not
because of any results or penalties external to sin, but because
sin separates us from God, our true life.&nbsp; The worst
punishment of sin, is sin itself.&nbsp; Into depths which make us
tremble as we strive to gaze into them, Christ our Lord descended
to deliver us from that deadly thing which is destroying our
life.&nbsp; That appalling Cry burst from His lips, that we might
learn to fear and dread sin worse than any pang of physical
pain.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This Word, again, discloses the Mind of Christ, true
Man, in its relation to God.&nbsp; He possessed fullest
self-consciousness both as God and as Man.&nbsp; Thus He Himself
alone knew, in their absolute fulness, the joy and the strength
which come from the communion of man with God.&nbsp; That joy and
that strength, in the measure in which we can attain to their
realisation, are to be the goal of all our striving.&nbsp; Thus
this Word has for us more than a merely negative teaching.&nbsp;
Not only are we to shrink from that which destroys union with
God.&nbsp; We must seek far more earnestly to make that union a
greater and a deeper reality.&nbsp; This end we can achieve by
making our prayers more deliberate acts of conscious communion
with that Person Who is not merely above us, but in us, and in
Whom &ldquo;we live, and move, and have our being.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We must all make the confession <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>that we
have not yet nearly realised all that prayer might be to us, if
only we were more energetic, more strenuous, more utterly in
earnest, in our attempts to pray.&nbsp; It is by prayer that we
are to attain to our complete manhood, to &ldquo;win our
souls,&rdquo; to become our true selves.</p>
<blockquote><p>For what are men better than sheep or goats,<br />
Which nourish a blind life within the brain,<br />
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer,<br />
Both for themselves, and those that call them friend?<br />
For so the whole round world is, every way,<br />
Bound with gold chains about the feet of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span

THE FIFTH WORD</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">John</span> <span class="smcap">xix.</span> 28.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only utterance of our Blessed Lord in which He
gave expression to His physical sufferings.&nbsp; Not least of
these was that intolerable thirst which is the invariable result
of all serious wounds, as those know well who have ever visited
patients in a hospital after they have undergone a surgical
operation.&nbsp; In this case it must have been aggravated beyond
endurance by exposure to the burning heat of an Eastern
sun.&nbsp; This word, then, spoken under such circumstances,
discloses the Mind of the Son of God, perfect Man, in regard to
physical pain.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Notice then, in the first place, the majestic calm of
this word.&nbsp; It was spoken in intensest agony, yet with
deliberation, exhibiting the restraint of the sovereign and
victorious will of the Sufferer.&nbsp; &ldquo;After these things,
knowing that all things had now been accomplished, He saith [not
&lsquo;cried&rsquo;], I thirst.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot be wrong
in reading this marvellous word in the light of that strange
passage in the Epistle to <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the
Hebrews, where the writer tells us that Christ, &ldquo;although
He was Son, yet learnt He obedience by the things which He
suffered.&rdquo;&nbsp; How are we to reconcile this with the
moral perfection of our Lord&rsquo;s humanity?&nbsp; We can only
do so, by applying the Aristotelian distinction between the
potential and the actual.&nbsp; The obedience of the Son of God,
existing as it did in all possible perfection from the first
moment of His human consciousness, yet existed, prior to His
complete identification of Himself with all our human experience,
as a potentiality.&nbsp; It became actual, in the same way as our
obedience can alone become actual, as a result of that
experience, and, above all, in consequence of those sufferings
which were part of that experience.&nbsp; In this sense He
&ldquo;learnt obedience,&rdquo; where we too must learn it, in
God&rsquo;s school of pain.</p>
<p>Therein lies the answer, as complete an answer as we can at
present receive, to the problem of pain.&nbsp; While that problem
is, beyond doubt, the most perplexing of all the questions which
confront us, the real difficulty lies, not in the existence of
pain in God&rsquo;s world, but in the apparent absence, in so
many instances, of any discernible purpose in pain.&nbsp; In
itself, pain does not, or at least should not, conflict with the
highest moral conception which we can form of the character of
God.&nbsp; But purposeless pain, if such really occur anywhere in
the universe, is hard indeed to reconcile with the revelation of
the Highest <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>as Infinite and Eternal Love.&nbsp;
The real answer to the problem lies in our gradually dawning
perception of the high purposes which pain subserves.</p>
<p>It is well, then, to remind ourselves of the teaching of
natural science in regard to the function of pain in the animal
world.&nbsp; There, at least, it has originated, and has
survived, only because of its actual use to the possessors of
that nervous system which makes pain possible.&nbsp; It serves as
a danger signal of such inestimable value that no race of
animals, of any high degree of organisation, which could be
incapable of suffering pain, could for any length of time
continue to survive.&nbsp; Pain here, at any rate, so far from
being purposeless, owes its existence to the purpose which it
subserves.</p>
<p>Ascending higher in the scale of being we see, as has been
recently pointed out, that the progress of human civilisation has
been very largely due to the successful efforts of man to resist
and to remove pain.&nbsp; The most successful and progressive
races of mankind are those which inhabit regions of the world
where the conditions of life are neither so severe as to paralyse
all exertion, or even to preclude its possibility, nor so
favourable that men can avoid the pain of hunger or of cold
without strenuous and unremitting effort.&nbsp; The stimulus of
pain has been the means of perfecting the animal nature of man,
and the secret of those victories which he has won over the
inclement or dangerous forces of the material <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>world, and
which we call, in their totality, human civilisation.</p>
<p>And thus we come in sight of a great law, &ldquo;perfection
through suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the revelation of the Cross
is the exhibition to us of this law acting in the higher reaches
of man&rsquo;s existence, in the moral and spiritual regions of
his life.&nbsp; As the animal has gained its victories in the
past, so the spiritual is advancing towards the final triumph of
man, along the same path, of healthy reaction stimulated and
necessitated by pain.</p>
<p>For wherein lies the triumph of the spiritual nature, save in
its complete and sovereign control over all the other elements in
our complex being?&nbsp; The spiritual man is not the man who has
starved his physical or intellectual being; but the man whose
whole nature, harmoniously developed in the whole range of its
varied gifts and powers and faculties, is altogether brought
under the mastery of that which is highest in him, that spirit in
which he is akin to God, the wearer of the Divine Image.&nbsp;
The saintliest, loftiest characters of men and women have been
the fruits of this discipline.</p>
<p>We see the final demonstration of the purpose of pain in Him
Who &ldquo;learnt obedience by the things which He
suffered.&rdquo;&nbsp; This one word which tells of physical
suffering, tells also, as we have already seen, of the victory
gained over it by His human Spirit.&nbsp; It was by the reaction
of that Spirit under sharpest <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>bodily
pain, that the moral perfection of the Son of man ceased to be
potential, and became actual.&nbsp; So it is with us, so at least
it may be in ever-increasing measure, when pain is accepted and
met in the way in which Christ accepted and met His pain, not in
the spirit of useless and wild rebellion against the laws of the
universe, nor in that of a blind, fatalistic, and unintelligent
fatalism, which calls itself resignation.&nbsp; We may, hence,
learn to look beyond and behind pain to that great law of
perfection through suffering which takes effect, as it were,
spontaneously in lower forms of life; but which, in the realm of
the moral and the spiritual, demands the co-operation of the
human mind and will.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We may see also, in the fifth word, the revelation of
the attitude of the Son of God towards His own body.&nbsp; That
attitude, and hence the only genuinely and characteristically
Christian attitude, may be best described as the mean between the
pampering of the body, and its savage neglect in the interests of
a <i>false</i> asceticism.</p>
<p>As at first He put aside &ldquo;the slumberous potion
bland&rdquo; and willed &ldquo;to feel all, that He might pity
all,&rdquo; so, now His task is over, He craves, and accepts,
alleviation of His bodily pain.&nbsp; It is a wonderful
illustration of the true, the Christian way of regarding the
body.&nbsp; The human body is essentially a good and holy
thing.&nbsp; Those sins which we call &ldquo;bodily,&rdquo; like
all sins, have their origin in the <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>rebellious
will.&nbsp; They are only distinguished from other sins, because
in them the will uses the body, and in other sins other God-given
endowments of our nature, in opposition to the eternal goodness
which is the Will of God.&nbsp; We cannot too often remember,
that &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil&rdquo; are terms
applicable to the will alone.</p>
<p>That splendid gift of the body has been given to us, in order
that in it, and through it, we might &ldquo;glorify God&rdquo;;
that is, do His Will, the only thing utterly worth doing.&nbsp;
<i>Therefore</i>, we have to keep our bodies &ldquo;fit,&rdquo;
fit in all ways for their high and holy purpose.&nbsp; There is
the law, the standard of all Christian self-discipline.&nbsp;
Think of the glory of the prospect which it holds out to us, of
the development and destiny of the body.&nbsp; Think of the care
which we should bestow upon it, of the awful reverence with which
we should regard this (in the Divine intention) splendid and
perfect instrument for the fulfilment of the Will of God.&nbsp;
For what reverence can be too great for that which the Eternal
God chose as the tabernacle in which He should dwell among men,
as the instrument by which He should do the Father&rsquo;s Will
on earth?</p>
<p>Of all the religions of the world it is the religion of Jesus
Christ alone which bids us &ldquo;glorify God&rdquo; in the body,
that is, do His Will in and by that glorious instrument which He
has created and redeemed for His service.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>3.&nbsp; Finally, we may remind ourselves, very
briefly, that we, in our own day, may share the blessedness of
the Roman soldier who relieved the sufferings of Christ.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these My
brethren, ye have done it unto Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Christians, we <i>must</i> have <i>some</i> ministry to
fulfil towards the suffering members of Christ&rsquo;s
Body.&nbsp; In the parable of the sheep and the goats, the
eternal destiny of men is shown to depend, in the last resort,
upon the manner in which they have performed, or failed to
perform, this ministry.&nbsp; The complexities of modern life
call for careful thought in regard to the manner in which we are
to fulfil this duty, but they cannot relieve us of it.&nbsp;
Somewhere or other in our lives we must be diligently relieving
the necessities of others, ministering to their needs of body,
mind, or spirit.&nbsp; Else&mdash;there is no shirking this
conclusion&mdash;we are simply failing in the most characteristic
of all Christian virtues; we are far removed from the Mind of Him
Who &ldquo;went about doing good&rdquo;; we are on the way to
hear that final condemnation, &ldquo;Because ye did it not to the
least of these My brethren, ye did it not to Me.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is accomplished.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">St. John</span> <span class="smcap">xix.</span>
30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; What had been accomplished?&nbsp; In the first place,
that work which Christ had come into the world to do.&nbsp; All
that work may be resumed in a single word,
&ldquo;sacrifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Son of God had come for this
one purpose, to offer a sacrifice.&nbsp; Here is room for serious
misunderstanding.&nbsp; The blood, the pain, the death, were not
the sacrifice.&nbsp; Nothing visible was the sacrifice, least of
all the physical surroundings of its culminating act.&nbsp; There
is only one thing which can rightly be called sacrifice&mdash;or,
to put it otherwise, one sacrifice which alone has any worth,
alone can win any acceptance in the sight of God&mdash;and that
is, the obedience of the human will, the will of man brought into
perfect union with that Divine Will which is its own highest
moral ideal.</p>
<p>The perfect obedience of the human will of Christ to the
Divine Will, could only be realised&mdash;such were the
circumstances under which the mission received of the Father was
to be fulfilled by Him for the good of man&mdash;by His
faithfulness unto death.&nbsp; &ldquo;He became <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>obedient unto death,&rdquo; because in such a world
perfect faithfulness must lead to death.&nbsp; But the death of
Christ was no isolated fact, standing out solitary and alone from
the rest of His ministry.&nbsp; It was not merely of one piece
with, but the natural and fitting close of the whole.&nbsp; The
death of uttermost obedience was the crown and consummation of
the obedient life.&nbsp; On the Cross, He was carrying His
life&rsquo;s work to its triumphant close.&nbsp; His Death was,
itself, His victory.</p>
<p>This victorious aspect of the Passion is that on which St.
John chiefly dwells.&nbsp; The &ldquo;glorification&rdquo; of the
Son of man, His &ldquo;lifting up,&rdquo; was the whole series of
events extending from the Passion to the Ascension.&nbsp; So the
first Christians loved to think of the Cross, not as the
instrument of unutterable pain, but as the symbol of their
Master&rsquo;s triumph.&nbsp; It is this feeling, this
apprehension of the Johannine teaching on the Passion, which
accounts for the late appearance of the crucifix.&nbsp; Even
when, at last, the actual sufferings of the Saviour are depicted,
we are still far removed from medieval realism.&nbsp; There are
no nails&mdash;the Saviour is outstretched on the Cross by the
moral power of His own will, steadfast and victorious in its
obedience.&nbsp; The Sacred Face is not convulsed with agony, but
is turned, with calm and benignant aspect, towards men whom He
blesses.&nbsp; The earliest representations of the Passion, as we
have noticed before, are far nearer to the spirit of <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>the gospels, that of St. John above all, than those of
the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But the ministry itself was but the consummation of
the age-long work now &ldquo;accomplished.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Throughout the whole course of man&rsquo;s history, in the entire
spiritual evolution, whose first steps and rude beginnings we
trace in the burial mounds of prehistoric races, He Whose lips
now uttered that great &ldquo;It is accomplished&rdquo; had been
the light of men, never amid thick clouds of error and cruelty
and superstition wholly extinguished.&nbsp; In every approach of
man to God however dimly conceived of, the Word, the Eternal Son,
had been offering Himself in sacrifice to the Father.</p>
<p>So here, in the perfect act of the moral obedience of a human
will, is that to which all sacrifices not only pointed forward
but, all the time, meant, and aimed at, and symbolised, as men so
slowly and so painfully groped after, felt their way to God,
&ldquo;if haply they might find Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is accomplished&rdquo;&mdash;the true meaning of
sacrifice, of all religion, heathen and Jewish, is attained and
laid bare.</p>
<p>Thousands of years of human development reach their climax,
find their issue and their explanation in these words.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In its teaching, this sixth word ascends to the
heights, to the mysterious and ineffable relationships of the
Godhead&mdash;which are the inner reality <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and meaning
of all morality and religion&mdash;and it descends to the depths,
to the lowliest details of the most commonplace life.</p>
<p>All work, for the Christian, is raised to the level, to the
dignity of sacrifice.&nbsp; Once and for all we must rid
ourselves of that idea which has wrought so much mischief, that
sacrifice necessarily connotes pain, loss, death.&nbsp;
Essentially our sacrifice is what essentially Christ&rsquo;s
sacrifice was, the joyous dedication of the will to God, the
Source and Light of all our being.</p>
<blockquote><p>The daily round, the common task,<br />
Will furnish all we need to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All work is sacred, or may be so, if we will.&nbsp; For all
work has been consecrated for evermore by the perfect obedience,
that is, the perfect sacrifice of the Son of man, the Head of our
race.&nbsp; There is no task which any Christian, anywhere, can
be called upon to do, which cannot be made part of that joyous
service, that glad sacrifice, which, in union with that of Jesus
Christ our Lord, we, one with Him in sacramental union,
&ldquo;offer and present&rdquo; to the Father.</p>

THE SEVENTH WORD</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend My
spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> <span
class="smcap">xxiii.</span> 46.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consummation of sacrifice, the union of the human will
with the Divine, leads to the perfect rest in God.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We have tried to deal with the Seven Words as
constituting a revelation of the Divine Sonship of
humanity.&nbsp; From this point of view it is significant that
the first and the last begin, like the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, with
a direct address to the Father.</p>
<p>The service of the Christian man is that of a son in his
father&rsquo;s house, of a free man, not of a slave.&nbsp; The
Fatherhood of God is the very key-note of the Christian view of
life and of death.&nbsp; In both alike we are the objects of the
Father&rsquo;s individual care and love; in both we bear the
supreme dignity of &ldquo;the sons of the Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That dignity belongs inalienably to our human nature as
such.&nbsp; Baptism conveys no gift alien and <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>extraneous
to our manhood.&nbsp; Rather, that union with the Only Begotten
Son is not an addition to, but the restoration of our nature by
Him in Whose Image it was created.&nbsp; United thus to the
Eternal Son, we are placed in a position to realise the
possibilities of our being, to become that which we are
constituted capable of becoming.&nbsp; That is the true answer to
the question, how can we be made children of God by Baptism?</p>
<p>And through work, and prayer, and suffering, we are to grow
into, and perfectly realise, our Divine sonship.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; These dying words of the Son of God breathe no spirit
of mere passive resignation.&nbsp; That is the spirit of the
Oriental fatalist, not of the son conscious of his sonship, of
his heirship.&nbsp; Even the Lord&rsquo;s Death was not the
yielding to inexorable necessity, to the inevitable working of
the laws of nature.&nbsp; It was, if anything in His Life was,
the deliberate act of His conscious Will.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
commend,&rdquo; rather, &ldquo;I commit My Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I lay down My life . . . therefore the Father loveth
Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Submission to the Will of God is not necessarily a Christian
virtue at all.&nbsp; What is Christian is the glad recognition of
what manner of will the Divine Will is, how altogether
&ldquo;good, perfect, and acceptable,&rdquo; how infinitely
righteous, and holy, and loving; the doing of that glorious Will
with mind, and heart, <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>and will, and body; the praying with
all sincerity and intention that that Will, which is the
happiness and joy and life of all creatures, may increasingly
&ldquo;be done, as in heaven, so on earth&rdquo;; the free and
glad surrender, in life and death, to that Will which is the
perfection and consummation of our manhood.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Such an attitude of our whole being, which is what is
meant by being a Christian, can only be ours by virtue of the
Spirit of the Son of God dwelling and working within us, and
moulding us into His perfect Likeness.&nbsp; In Him alone we can
come to our sonship, to that which is from the first,
potentially, our own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are all sons of God,
through faith, in Christ Jesus; for as many of you as were
baptised into Christ did put on Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Work and
suffering, life and death, can only be borne, and lived, and
endured by us in the spirit of sonship, so far as we are actually
&ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us pray that the Mind and Will of the Son of God,
disclosed to us in these Seven Words, may be ours in
ever-increasing measure.&nbsp; They can be ours, if we are in
Him, and He in us.</p>
<p>The foundation fact of the Christian life, that which alone
makes it possible, is our union, through sacraments and faith,
with Christ; our actual sharing in His Life, imparted by His
Spirit to the members of His Body.&nbsp; We are meant to be ever
drawing upon the infinite moral resources of that Life by
repeated <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>acts of faith.&nbsp; For, as with
all other gifts of God, so it is with this, His supreme gift; we
only know it as ours&mdash;it is, in a real sense, only truly our
own&mdash;in proportion as we are using it.</p>
<h3><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span

ADDRESS ON EASTER EVE</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We were buried, therefore, with Him through
baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised from the dead
by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of
life.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rom.</span> <span
class="smcap">vi.</span> 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I delivered unto you, among the first things, that . .
. He was buried.&rdquo;&mdash;I <span class="smcap">Cor.</span>
<span class="smcap">xv.</span> 3, 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Paul lays extraordinary and, at first sight, inexplicable
stress, on the fact of our Lord&rsquo;s Burial.&nbsp; It is
certainly strange that, in the second of these two texts, he
mentions it as constituting, along with the Death of Jesus Christ
for our sins, and His Resurrection on the third day according to
the Scriptures, the foundation truths of the apostolic gospel, as
being one of those &ldquo;first things&rdquo; of the Christian
religion which, as he had &ldquo;received,&rdquo; so had he
&ldquo;delivered&rdquo; to the Corinthians.</p>
<p>This extreme importance attached by St. Paul to the Burial of
Christ, can only be explained by the mysticism of the great
apostle.&nbsp; To him the outward facts, however wonderful and
striking in themselves, are of value only as &ldquo;signs,&rdquo;
as representing great moral and spiritual realities.&nbsp; To
him, as to every man who thinks soberly and steadily, the
internal is <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>&ldquo;real&rdquo; in a sense in
which the external is not: thought has a reality denied to
&ldquo;things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real meaning of Christ&rsquo;s Burial is the mystical
meaning, that meaning which was brought home to the minds of the
early Christians by the picturesque and symbolic ritual of
baptism.&nbsp; The man who had, by faith, accepted Christ as his
Lord and Master, was baptised into His Death; that is, in Him he
died to the old life.&nbsp; His submergence beneath the baptismal
waters, the very likeness of the Burial, was the assurance and
the sealing of that death.&nbsp; As truly as the man who is dead
and buried is cut off for ever from the life of this world, so
was the baptised separated, once and for all, from the old
heathen life with all its associations.&nbsp; As clearly did his
emergence from those waters show forth his actual participation
in the Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection.&nbsp; He had not merely left
the old life behind, he had from that moment entered upon the new
life, the &ldquo;life of God&rdquo;; that is, the life which
henceforth had God for its foundation, its centre, and its goal;
the life of moral health and sanity; the life which was to be, in
all its relations, open and clear and undismayed; the life
&ldquo;in the Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first thought, then, of Easter Eve must surely be
one of profound sorrow and humiliation.&nbsp; We ought to be
bowed to the very earth with self-abasement by the thought that
we have been, so many times in the past, untrue to our
baptism.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Soldiers of Christ, we have denied our Lord.&nbsp;
More, ours has been the guilt, not of Peter only, but of
Judas.&nbsp; Too often we have betrayed Him for the veriest
pittance of this world&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We have missed the glory of the Risen Life.&nbsp; All the
magnificent language of the Epistle to the Ephesians, the
quickening with Christ, the raising together with Him from the
dead, the enthronement in Him in the heavenly places&mdash;all
this was written of Christians in this life.&nbsp; All this might
have been true of us, and is not; for, worse than Esau, we have
bartered away an incomparably more magnificent heritage.</p>
<p>What remains for us to do on this Easter Eve but, with truest
penitence, with utter loathing of self, and utter longing for Him
Who is our true self, to cast ourselves at the Feet of
Christ?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But the second thought of Easter Eve is one of
boundless hope.&nbsp; But remember, hope can only begin at the
Feet of Christ.&nbsp; For Christian hope has evermore its
beginning and its ground in humility.&nbsp; We only find safety,
comfort, joy, encouragement, as we lie, prostrate in penitence,
before our Redeemer.&nbsp; It is clear, is it not, what we mean
by all this?&nbsp; We are, simply and naturally, to kneel before
our Lord, and acknowledge to Him all our untruth, all our
disloyalty, all the manifold failures of our service.&nbsp; And
the very fact that we can do this sincerely and honestly, is the
earnest of all good things to come in <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>us.&nbsp;
If only we can make this genuine and heartfelt confession, there
is no degree of moral recovery beyond our reach.</p>
<p>For on Easter Eve we try to realise once more that greatest of
Christian truths, the <i>power</i> of Christ&rsquo;s
Resurrection.&nbsp; The power which was manifested in the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is the power which is
universally present in nature and in mind, which is the reality
behind all forces of nature, which all forces reveal.&nbsp; It
has been finely said, that &ldquo;the opening of a rose-bud and
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ are facts of the same order, for
they are equally manifestations of the one force which is the
motive power of all phenomena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We see that power in the glories of the opening spring; we are
conscious of it in ourselves, in every good resolve, every upward
aspiration.&nbsp; There comes to us the inspiring thought, that
the physical and the moral Resurrection alike, in nature, in
ourselves, in Jesus Christ, are different manifestations of one
and the same power.&nbsp; Was the Resurrection of the Lord a
mighty fact, the greatest of all the facts of history, a
transcendent and astonishing miracle?&nbsp; The power which
wrought it is in me; the same wondrous fact, the same stupendous
miracle, if I will, may be accomplished in me.</p>
<p>That was the very meaning of my Christian calling&mdash;that
&ldquo;as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
Father,&rdquo; so I, by the self-same power, might be <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>raised from the death of sin, and enabled &ldquo;to
walk in newness of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Death, the Burial, and
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ are not merely historical facts,
external to me: they are meant to be spiritual facts in my own
experience, in the experience of all Christians.&nbsp; And
spiritual facts are beyond measure greater in value and meaning
and influence than those historical facts which happened in space
and time, in order to serve as signs and symbols of the inward
and eternal realities.</p>
<p>So let us come to our Easter Communion, not only in the spirit
of penitence, but in the spirit of undying and unconquerable
hope.&nbsp; There is no limit to that which the power of God,
symbolised, embodied externally, in the Resurrection, may effect
within us, in the region of our moral and spiritual life.&nbsp;
Or rather, there is no limit to the exercise of the Divine power,
save that which we ourselves impose upon it, by our failure to
correspond with it.&nbsp; Now as ever it is true, true of the
work of God&rsquo;s grace upon our souls, as of the healing power
of Christ over the bodies of men, that &ldquo;according to our
faith&rdquo; it shall be done to us.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
